DESCRIPTION:<p>More than 10% of the population has dyslexia\, and most are
  diagnosed only after they fail in school. My work is \nchanging this thro
 ugh scalable early detection and tools that help people with dyslexia read
  and write better. To \ndetect dyslexia\, I am developing machine learning
  models that predict reading and writing difficulties by watching \nhow pe
 ople interact with my web-based game Dytective. My experiments have reveal
 ed differences in how people with \ndyslexia read and write\, and I have d
 eveloped a series of tools that integrate these results to help people wit
 h \ndyslexia read and write better. These tools are used by tens of thousa
 nds of people\, which apart from supporting \nusers\, also serve as living
  laboratories in which to develop and prove techniques for detection and i
 ntervention. \nMoving forward\, we are working with schools to put our app
 roach into practice at scale to finally eliminate school \nfailure as a pr
 imary way dyslexia is diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Luz Rello is a Post Doctoral Fell
 ow at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institu
 te. She is \nalso an Ashoka Fellow\, invited expert to W3C-WAI and co-foun
 der of the Cookie Cloud team that creates applications \nfrom research res
 ults. She holds a degree in Linguistics (Complutense University of Madrid)
 \, a MSc in Natural \nLanguage Processing (University of Wolverhampton) an
 d a Ph.D. in Computer Science (Pompeu Fabra University). She has \nreceive
 d a number of awards\, including the MIT Technology Review 'Innovators und
 er 35 Award Spain' (2014) and the \nEuropean Young Researchers' Award (201
 3) for her work on applying technology for dyslexia using Linguistics\, HC
 I and \nNLP. Her IDEAL eBook reader and Dyseggxia game (Vodafone Foundatio
 n Mobile for Good Europe Awards 2013) have received \nnearly one hundred t
 housand downloads in more than 70 countries. Currently\, she is working to
  detect dyslexia at \nlarge scale and on bringing this work to society via
  her non-profit organization Change Dyslexia.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Search engines and web-based resources have become ubiquito
 us and essential tools for supporting the use of \ninteractive systems. (e
 .g\, Microsoft PowerPoint\, Adobe Photoshop\, etc.) For example\, people r
 ely on web resources to \nlearn new tasks\, troubleshoot problems\, or rem
 ind themselves of key task details. This reliance on search engines and \n
 web-based resources generates a rich set of signals that characterizes how
  the population thinks about and uses \nsoftware systems "in the wild\," o
 n a day-to-day basis. </p>\n<p>In this talk\, I demonstrate how these sign
 als can be extracted and leveraged. Specifically\, I show how logs of onli
 ne \ninteractions can be used to identify potential usability problems in 
 any publicly available interactive system. I \nshow how web tutorials can 
 be used to map a broad user vocabulary to the narrow vocabulary expressed 
 in a user \ninterface. Finally\, I demonstrate how web resources and softw
 are applications can mutually enhance each other by \nmeans of a shared in
 teraction history. I conclude with an outline of my long-term research vis
 ion\, which casts \nsoftware applications\, web search\, and online suppor
 t materials as interoperating components of a larger holistic \nsystem to 
 be studied\, designed\, and evaluated in concert.</p>\n<p>Adam Fourney joi

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Krzysztof Gajos (Harvard University) - "From Paid to
  Organic Crowdsourcing"

DESCRIPTION:<p>Human computation systems seamlessly combine human percepti
 on\, creativity and knowledge with machine-driven \nalgorithmic computatio
 n.  Such systems have been demonstrated to accomplish tasks that could not
  previously be \naccomplished by either machines or by non-experts alone. 
  Contemporary human computation systems frequently recruit \nhuman contrib
 utions from online micro-labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.  Wh
 ile convenient\, this approach \nlimits the scale\, scope and quality of w
 ork.</p>\n<p>In contrast\, my group's work has contributed to a largely un
 explored area of "organic" crowdsourcing\, an area that \nbuilds on insigh
 ts from social computing research and on recent advances in human computat
 ion.  In organic \ncrowdsourcing\, intrinsically motivated people contribu
 te to human computation workflows as a byproduct of performing \nactivitie
 s that they find inherently valuable.  In successful organic crowdsourcing
  systems\, the addition of the \nhuman computation element enhances (inste
 ad of detracting from) the main activity\, while also resulting in useful 
 \nwork being done.  For example\, with our Crowdy system\, people learning
  from tutorial videos get prompted with short \nquizzes. The quizzes are d
 esigned such that by answering them\, people contribute to a workflow that
  improves those \nsame videos for future learners.  The quizzes are also d
 esigned to be pedagogically valuable.  The results of our \nstudy show tha
 t the improvements to the tutorial videos generated by Crowdy are comparab
 le in quality to those \nproduced by experts.  Our results also demonstrat
 e that people who view tutorial videos with Crowdy and participate \nin qu
 izzes learn more than people who watch the same videos with a traditional 
 video interface.  I will present three \norganic crowdsourcing projects fr
 om our group and share an initial synthesis of generalizable principles fo
 r the \ndesign of organic crowdsourcing systems.</p>\n<p>Krzysztof Gajos i

  his group contributed to diverse \nareas such as personalized adaptive us
 er interfaces\, systems for supporting collective creativity\, organic \nc
 rowdsourcing\, large-scale experimentation in the wild\, and learning tech

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Been Kim (Computer Science & Engineering) - "Interac
 tive and Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Human Machine Collabora

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151028T120000

DESCRIPTION:<p>I envision a system that enables successful collaborations 
 between humans and machine learning models by harnessing \nthe relative st
 rength to accomplish what neither can do alone. Machine learning technique
 s and humans have skills \nthat complement each other --- machine learning
  techniques are good at computation on data at the lowest level of \ngranu
 larity\, whereas people are better at abstracting knowledge from their exp
 erience\, and transferring the knowledge \nacross domains. The goal of my 
 research is to develop a framework for human-in-the-loop machine learning 
 that enables \npeople to interact effectively with machine learning models
  to make better decisions using large datasets\, without \nrequiring in-de
 pth knowledge about machine learning techniques.</p>\n<p>In this talk\, I 
 present the Bayesian Case Model (BCM)\, a general framework for Bayesian c
 ase-based reasoning (CBR) \nand prototype classification and clustering. B
 CM brings the intuitive power of CBR to a Bayesian generative \nframework.
  The BCM learns prototypes\, the "quintessential" observations that best r
 epresent clusters in a dataset\, by \nperforming joint inference on cluste
 r labels\, prototypes and important features. Simultaneously\, BCM pursues
  sparsity \nby learning subspaces\, the sets of features that play importa
 nt roles in the characterization of the prototypes. The \nprototype and su
 bspace representation provides quantitative benefits in interpretability w
 hile preserving \nclassification accuracy. Human subject experiments verif
 y statistically significant improvements to participants' \nunderstanding 
 when using explanations produced by BCM\, compared to those given by prior
  art. I demonstrate the \napplication of this model for an educational dom
 ain in which teachers cluster programming assignments to streamline \nthe 
 grading process. </p>\n<p>Been Kim is a Research Scientist at AI2. She is 
 also an affiliated faculty in the Department of Computer Science &amp\; \n
 Engineering at the University of Washington. Her research focuses on inter
 active and interpretable machine learning \nmodels for human-machine colla
 boration. She received her PhD. from MIT. Prior to her PhD\, she worked at
  the MathWorks \nas a software engineer.</p>

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Christian Holz (Microsoft Research) - "Glass Fibers\

DESCRIPTION:<p>In this talk\, I explore the higher dimensions of touch inp
 ut. I show how to enable mobile devices to sense 3D \ninformation about th
 e space above them from just the touch input they observe. I present a ser
 ies of touchscreen \ndevices that capture users' fingerprints upon touch\,
  from which they conclude 3D information. Just like camera-based \n3D trac
 king systems provide the opportunity for more natural and expressive inter
 action\, deriving such information \nfrom touch provides similar benefits.
  While camera-based systems require a certain distance between sensor and 
 \ntracked objects\, however\, touchscreens sense information directly on t
 heir surface\, which allows them to remain \nthin--the form factor that ha
 s allowed such devices to achieve mobility and mass-adoption in the first 
 place. I \ndemonstrate that reconstructing 3D information from touch enabl
 es devices to increase their input accuracy by a \nfactor of three compare
 d to current devices and I show that fingerprint-sensing touchscreens solv
 e a long-standing \nchallenge in HCI: biometric user identification. I con
 clude with a new model of user authentication on touch devices\, \ndemonst
 rate how to implement seamless biometric authentication on commodity devic
 es\, and discuss the implications of \nthis model on existing operating sy
 stems and their user interfaces. </p>\n<p>Christian Holz is a researcher i
 n Human-Computer Interaction at Microsoft Research\, Redmond. His research
  focuses on \naugmenting the capabilities of existing mobile devices as we
 ll as creating new devices to enrich the sensing \ncapabilities of today's
  devices. Technology Review recently named Christian one of the 10 best in
 novators under 35 in \nGermany and his work has received honorable mention

DESCRIPTION:<p>League of Legends is an online game with over 67 million pl
 ayers playing the game every month. As the developer of \nLeague of Legend
 s\, Riot Games has been employing the latest research from social and cogn
 itive psychology mixed with \ntechniques like machine learning and game de
 sign to help create more positive online communities.</p>\n<p>One example 
 of such research was the Tribunal System\; this experimental system automa
 tically curated behaviors such \nas chat logs from online communities into
  "case files" that could be reviewed by players in League of Legends. \nDe
 pending on the case verdict\, the players under review would receive rewar
 ds or punishments for their behaviors. \nThis system collects over 105 mil
 lion trials of data a year in just North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>In a 
 second example\, we will show how you can utilize machine learning to stud
 y the evolution of language\, and how \nfeedback from the system can be us
 ed as an intervention to curb negative online behaviors. Finally\, we will
  discuss \nan experiment where we explored what happens when you deploy a 
 simple priming experiment to 67 million players over 4 \nweeks.</p>\n<p>Us
 ing online platforms as a medium for research\, many fields of psychology 
 could be on the verge of a breakthrough. \nIn the past year\, we have star
 ted collaborations with academic institutions to study cooperation and col
 lective \nintelligence\, online governance\, the evolution of language and
  more. We want to show you how online video games can \nforever change how
  we think about research and how your lab can get involved. </p>\n<p>Jeffr
 ey "Lyte" Lin is lead game designer of social systems and is responsible f
 or helping League of Legends have the \nmost sportsmanlike community in on
 line games. Dr. Lin and his team challenge the convention that online comm
 unities \nare and always will be toxic environments\; in fact\, some of th
 e team's latest work suggests that the vast majority of \nonline communiti
 es are positive or neutral. He runs experiments and data analyses\, transl
 ating the results and \nlearnings into viable game features that enhance e
 ngagement while amplifying the sportsmanlike behavior that already \nexist
 s in the community. Before Riot\, Jeffrey was an experimental psychologist
  at Valve Software and received his \nPh.D. in cognitive neuroscience from
  the University of Washington with Dr. Geoffrey Boynton and Dr. Scott Murr
 ay.  </p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>An estimated 95% of our scientific knowledge about people\,
  their behavior\, perception\, and preferences is based on \nstudies with 
 "WEIRD" samples\, an acronym for participants who are Western\, Educated\,
  Industrialized\, Rich\, and Democratic. \nMy work in Human-Computer Inter
 action has shown that technology developed for WEIRD users\, based on know
 ledge that is \nderived from studies with mostly US-based student populati
 ons\, is often misaligned with the preferences\, behaviors\, \nand abiliti
 es of a large proportion of the world's population: Users differ in how th
 ey perceive information\, what \nthey find appealing\, and what they can w
 ork with most efficiently. </p>\n<p>A possible solution to the conventiona
 l "one size fits all" approach is to predict what a user likes and works w
 ith \nmost efficiently\, and to leverage this knowledge to design user int
 erfaces accordingly. In this talk\, I will show\nhow the online experiment
  platform LabintheWild (www.labinthewild.org) has enabled me to conduct la
 rge-scale behavioral\nexperiments needed to build such predictive models. 
 LabintheWild enables participants to compare themselves to \nothers in exc
 hange for study participation\; a feedback mechanism that has attracted an
  average of 1\,000 participants\na day from more than 200 countries and va
 rious demographic groups. I show how LabintheWild experiments have enabled
  me\nto study less WEIRD users than possible in conventional laboratory st
 udies\, and how the results of these studies allowed\nme to build systems 
 that predict what users like. </p>\n<p>Katharina Reinecke is an assistant 
 professor in the Computer Science &amp\; Engineering department at the Uni

  the University of Michigan School of Information and the \nDepartment of 
 Computer Science. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Univ
 ersity of Zurich\, Switzerland\,\nand spent her postdoctoral years at the 
 Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Her research in human-
 computer\ninteraction focuses on understanding how culture affects users' 
 perception\, behavior\, and preferences when interacting\nwith technology.
  Using data from her online experiment platform LabintheWild.org\, she bui
 lds systems that predict the\nsuitability of user interfaces for people ar
 ound the world. Katharina has received Best Paper awards and nominations\n
 at premier venues in human-computer interaction (ACM CHI\, ACM CSCW\, UMAP

DESCRIPTION:<p>Computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools and social medi
 a potentially allow people to interact fluidly across \nnational\, cultura
 l and linguistic boundaries in ways that would have been difficult if not 
 impossible in the past. \nTo date\, however\, however\, much of this poten
 tial fails to be realized. A single individual is unlikely to be \nfluent 
 in a wide array of languages. The use of a lingua franca such as English p
 ermits a degree of interaction \nwith speakers of other native languages\,
  but it can have negative effects on non-native speakers. Advances in \nma
 chine translation (MT) and other technologies could allow people to commun
 icate with one another in their native \nlanguage\, but translation errors
  can create sizeable misunderstandings when MT is used in conversational s
 ettings.  </p>\n<p>In a series of studies\, my students and I have been ex
 ploring the problem space of inter-lingual communication\, \nwith the goal
 s of better understanding the challenges of interaction across language bo
 undaries and of informing \nthe design of new tools to support this intera
 ction.  I will first describe two interview studies exploring how the \nne
 ed to use a non-native language affects communication and coordination in 
 both formal and informal settings. I \nwill then describe several tools we
  have developed to make MT more usable in everyday conversation and presen
 t the \nresults of lab studies evaluating these tools.  Taken together\, t
 hese studies help help advance the area of \ninter-lingual computer-mediat

DESCRIPTION:<p>Crowd-sourcing labor markets (e.g.\, Amazon Mechanical Turk
 ) are booming\, because they enable rapid construction of complex workflow
 s that seamlessly mix human computation with computer automation. Example 
 applications range from photo tagging to audio-visual transcription and in
 terlingual translation. Similarly\, workflows on citizen science sites (e.
 g. GalaxyZoo) have allowed ordinary people to pool their effort and make i
 nteresting discoveries. Unfortunately\, constructing a good workflow is di
 fficult\, because the quality of the work performed by humans is highly va
 riable. Typically\, a task designer will experiment with several alternati
 ve workflows to accomplish a task\, varying the amount of redundant labor\
 , until she devises a control strategy that delivers acceptable performanc
 e.</p>\n<p>Fortunately\, this control challenge can often be formulated as
  an automated planning problem ripe for algorithms from the probabilistic

DESCRIPTION:<p>Surgical telemedicine has emerged as a promising answer to 
 the increasing needs of everyday surgical collaboration \nand in situ educ
 ation. The implicit desire is to allow a remote surgeon to see the body as
  the local surgeon does in \norder to engage in shared decision-making or 
 instruction. With this talk I take a step back by discussing the \nproduct
 ive and cross-referential nature of surgical practice and image use. I dis
 cuss how it is not simply a case of \ntransferring recorded video\, but ra
 ther a new practice is instantiated in creating a view of the body for the
  remote \nsurgeon. In order to investigate these practices for capturing a
 nd using video\, I deployed a head-mounted video \ncamera (via the Google 
 Glass) in six transplant organ recovery assessments. Drawing on observatio
 ns and analysis of \nthe video artifacts\, I examine how the transmitting 
 surgeon crafts a view for the remote surgeon in order to \nfacilitate the 
 co-construction of knowledge and shared decision making.  I use these find
 ings to discuss further \ndesign directions for video use in surgical tele
 medicine.</p>\n<p>Helena Mentis\, PhD\, is an assistant professor in the D

 s. Given the rapid growth in popularity of multiplayer online battle arena
  (MOBA) games (e.g.\, Dota 2\, League\nof Legends) we investigated whether
  similar connections would be observed with this gamer population. In doin
 g so we addressed: (i)\nwhether a sample of experienced gamers and valid c
 ognitive task data could be collected at a MOBA tournament\, (ii) whether\
 nindividual differences in cognitive skills are connected to MOBA expertis

 results suggest that gaming tournaments should be considered for gathering
  a large sample of experienced gamers and\nthat specific cognitive skills

DESCRIPTION:<p>The Tactile Picture Book Project (TPBP) is a research endea
 vor that utilizes 3D printing as a new media platform\nfor designing\, dev
 eloping\, and distributing information in a tangible format. The mission o
 f TPBP is to give children\nwith visual impairments access to a lot more p
 ictures they can "see" by touch and feel. To date\, the TPBP team has\nmad
 e 3D adaptations for several children's book classics such as Goodnight Mo
 on\, Harold and the Purple Crayon\,\nThe Very Hungry Caterpillar\, Dear Zo
 o\, and Noah's Ark. In this talk\, Yeh will demonstrate examples of 3D pic
 tures\,\ndiscuss the technical challenges encountered in creating these pi
 ctures\, and share the many valuable lessons learned\nthrough the process.
  In addition\, Yeh will present CraftML\, a new 3D modeling markup languag
 e designed to mimic common\nweb technologies including HTML5\, CSS\, and J
 avascript. CraftML allows web designers without prior 3D modeling\nexperie
 nce to easily bring their creative talents and design skills to the domain
  of 3D modeling. The TPBP is\nsupported by a research grant from the Natio
 nal Science Foundation and has appeared in several news outlets such\nas 9
 News\, Newsweek\, DailyCamera\, DailyMail\, New Scientist\, Science Daily\
 , and NPR.</p>\n<p>Tom Yeh received his PhD from the Massachusetts Institu
 te of Technology for studying vision-based user interfaces.\nIn 2012\, he 
 joined the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) as an assistant professor i

DESCRIPTION:<p>Every day we make decisions about which technologies to use
 : what phone to buy\, \nhow to share files with collaborators\, how to che
 ck your bank balance. \nThese choices are not just about the best technolo
 gy for you to use as an \nindividual\, but also about the decisions made b
 y your colleagues\, family\, \nfriends and others around you. In this talk
 \, I’ll discuss research with over 180 \nparticipants exploring how peop
 le share passwords\, how they manage their bank \naccounts and finances\, 
 and how they store\, share and safeguard their photos\, \ndocuments and da
 ta. I’ll talk about the complex moral and emotional decisions \npeople n
 avigate as they make these decisions\, and I’ll discuss implications for
  \nstudying how people use technology\, as well as building technology tha
 t better \nsupports the balance between safeguarding and sharing.</p>\n<p>

 , one’s ability to make sense of this trace data and use it productively
  to \nimprove knowledge work has become work in its own right. In this tal
 k\, I present research that begins to explore two \nrelated challenges: (1
 ) understanding the ways in which knowledge workers are — and are not 
 — motivated to interact \nwith various representations of their trace da
 ta\, and (2) understanding how to manifest trace data in the work \nenviro
 nment in ways that make it present/visible in the right time and the right
  place as well as being appropriable \nfor helping individuals (and groups

DESCRIPTION:<p>The applications we create are framed by the tools we use t
 o create them. On one hand\, tools codify effective \npractice and empower
  design. On the other\, that same codification eventually constrains desig
 n. My research examines \nnew approaches to interactive systems in light o
 f this tradeoff\, often with an emphasis on unlocking existing \ncodificat
 ions to enable new designs. This talk will focus on three examples:</p>\n<
 ul>\n<li>I will first present our work on unlocking data with interactive 
 machine learning. Dominant models of interaction \n  fail to support expre
 ssiveness and control in many emerging forms of everyday data. Exploring s
 uch domains as \n  web image search and gesture recognition\, our work sho
 ws how interactive machine learning can support people \n  in extending th
 e underlying language of an interaction.</li>\n<li>I will then present our
  work on using pixel-based reverse engineering to unlock existing graphica
 l interfaces\, \n  allowing runtime modification of those interfaces witho
 ut their source. Pixel-based methods allow prototyping \n  new possibiliti
 es atop the existing ecosystem of applications and tools\, accelerating in
 novation and informing \n  the next-generation ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Finall
 y\, I will consider how these challenges combine in the emergence of self-
 tracking and personal informatics. \n  Data is no longer a distant concept
 \, but an everyday barrier to interaction\, self-knowledge\, and personal 
 empowerment. \n  The tools we create to support these applications will de
 fine the future of everyday interaction with personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<
 p>Given these examples\, I argue research must consider not only specific 
 applications\, but also the assumptions \ncodified by underlying tools and
  how those tools frame our understanding of what application designs are e
 ven possible.</p>\n<p>James Fogarty is an Associate Professor of Computer

  From digital photo albums to online music streaming services\, these new

 s have created many opportunities\, they also raise complex questions for 
 the HCI community as we critically look to the future and consider their l
 onger-term implications. As archives continue to grow\, how will people li

 s to digital data and the technologies that manifest them change over time
 ? What kinds of qualities should designers consider in crafting a longer-t

DESCRIPTION:<p>Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous but are not a

 hases. This requires human drivers to continually adapt to their changing 
 role inside the car. The human’s ability to decide when to take back con
 trol of the primary driving task is further complicated given system imper
 fections. As drivers adapt to increasing levels of automation\, they may c
 hange their driving behaviour in ways that can compromise and even negate 
 the intended system benefits. To design vehicles that account for limitati

DESCRIPTION:<p>The first week of each quarter focuses on communication and
  networking\nwithin the DUB community. Instead of a seminar speaker\, we h
 old a DUB faculty meeting\nand coordinate student small group lunches. See
  below for appropriate details.</p>\n<p>1) DUB Faculty Meeting</p>\n<ul>\n
 <li>CSE 691 (Gates Commons) on Wednesday at 12:00</li>\n<li>We Actually Ha
 ve Agenda Items</li>\n<li>But Mostly We Chat</li>\n<li>Lunch is Provided</
 li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) Student Group Lunches</p>\n<p>The heart of the DUB commu
 nity is our diversity of perspectives\, bringing together\npeople and idea
 s that might otherwise be hidden in our departments.\nWe want everybody in
  DUB to seek out some new DUB friends for lunch. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Have
  lunch in a group of 4 DUB people who all add something\n  different (e.g.
 \, different departments\, different research advisors\,\n  different disc
 iplinary background\, different years in their program).\n  You decide wha
 t brings different perspectives to your DUB lunch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tw
 eet your lunch @uwdub\, including a group selfie and telling\n  us what DU
 B means to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep your receipt. We will reimburse 
 up to $50 for your group of 4.\n  Lunch with diverse DUB friends is fun an
 d informative\, but free lunch is even better!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We ha
 ve created a speadsheet to help you find a group\, and where you\nneed to 
 enter your group and your tweet in order to coordinate\nreimbursement. For
  reimbursement sanity\, we will coordinate with the\nfirst person listed i
 n each group.</p>\n<p><a href="http://tiny.cc/uwdublunch">http://tiny.cc/u

DESCRIPTION:<p>This talk is based on the keynote presentation at the 18th 
 International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers\nand Accessibility (AS
 SETS 2016).   According to the Word Health Organization there are one bill
 ion people in the\nworld have a significant disability.  The view of disab
 ility has changed over the past 100 years and continues to change.\nAccess
 ibility has become a professional field both in research and practice.   T
 echnology originally intended for people with\ndisabilities has become use
 ful technologies for everyone.  More and more technology for people with d
 isability\nare being built into mainstream products.  For example\, screen
  readers are built into iOS and Android platforms.\nMainstream companies a
 re beginning to require knowledge of accessibility best practices in their
  job descriptions.\nMore and more accessibility research is appearing in m
 ainstream conferences.\nOverall\, accessibility is becoming mainstream in 
 both research and practice.</p>\n<p>Richard Ladner is a professor in Compu
 ter Science and Engineering at the University of Washington\,\nwhere he ha
 s been on the faculty since 1971.  He received in B.S. degree in Mathemati
 cs at\nSt. Mary’s College of California in 1965 and his Ph.D. in Mathema
 tics from the University of California\,\nBerkeley in 1971. After many yea
 rs of doing research in theoretical computer science\,\nhe turned his atte
 ntion in 2004 to accessibility research\, especially on technology for peo
 ple\nwho are blind\, deaf\, and deaf-blind.  Some notable projects include
  the Tactile Graphics Project\, MobileASL\,\nASL-STEM Forum\, and MobileAc
 cessibility.  He wrote a short article for the SIGACCESS Newsletter about\
 nhis transition from theoretical computer science research to accessibilit
 y research:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/wp-content/uploads/f

DESCRIPTION:<p>Emotions play an important role in our everyday lives. They
  influence memory\, decision-making and well-being.  In order to advance t
 he fundamental understanding of human emotions\, build smarter affective t
 echnology\, and ultimately help people\, we need to perform research in-si
 tu. It is now possible to quantify emotional responses on a large scale us
 ing webcams and wearable devices in everyday environments. I will present 
 work on state-of-the-art automated facial expression recognition tools and
  insights from analysis from the world’s largest dataset of naturalistic
  emotional responses (featuring examples from millions of individuals). I'
 ll show examples of how this data has allowed us to corroborate and extend
  the understanding of nonverbal behavior\, including modeling gender and c
 ultural differences in expression (and what makes a viral video). I'll pre
 sent methods for remotely measuring physiology using webcams that allow lo
 w-cost and highly scalable measurement of cardio-pulmonary activity includ
 ing heart rate variability allowing us to capture sympathetic nervous syst
 em activity in addition to expressions. Finally\, I will discuss how this 
 work will help us bring emotional intelligence to everyday digital devices
  and potentially track important health conditions. </p>\n<p><a href="http

DESCRIPTION:<p>ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a degenerative neuro
 muscular disease\; people with late-stage ALS typically retain cognitive f
 unction\, but lose the motor ability to speak\, relying on gaze-controlled
  AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) devices for interpersona
 l interactions. State-of-the-art AAC technologies used by people with ALS 
 do not facilitate natural communication\; gaze-based AAC communication is 
 extremely slow (typically below 20 wpm\, compared to 190 wpm for conversat
 ional speech)\, and the resulting synthesized speech is flat and robotic. 
 In this talk\, I will present a series of novel technology prototypes from
  the Microsoft Research Enable team that aim to address the challenges of 
 improving the throughput and expressivity of AAC for people with ALS.  </p

 nd Accessibility ("social accessibility")\, creating technologies that fac
 ilitate people with disabilities in connecting with others in social and p
 rofessional contexts. Past research contributions include foundational wor
 k in facilitating cooperative interactions in the domain of surface comput
