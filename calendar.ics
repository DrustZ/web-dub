DESCRIPTION:<p>More than 10% of the population has dyslexia\, and most are
  diagnosed only after they fail in school. My work is changing this throug
 h scalable early detection and tools that help people with dyslexia read a
 nd write better. To detect dyslexia\, I am developing machine learning mod
 els that predict reading and writing difficulties by watching how people i
 nteract with my web-based game Dytective. My experiments have revealed dif
 ferences in how people with dyslexia read and write\, and I have developed
  a series of tools that integrate these results to help people with dyslex
 ia read and write better. These tools are used by tens of thousands of peo
 ple\, which apart from supporting users\, also serve as living laboratorie
 s in which to develop and prove techniques for detection and intervention.
  Moving forward\, we are working with schools to put our approach into pra
 ctice at scale to finally eliminate school failure as a primary way dyslex
 ia is diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Luz Rello is a Post Doctoral Fellow at Carnegie M
 ellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. She is also 
 an Ashoka Fellow\, invited expert to W3C-WAI and co-founder of the Cookie 
 Cloud team that creates applications from research results. She holds a de
 gree in Linguistics (Complutense University of Madrid)\, a MSc in Natural 
 Language Processing (University of Wolverhampton) and a Ph.D. in Computer 
 Science (Pompeu Fabra University). She has received a number of awards\, i
 ncluding the MIT Technology Review 'Innovators under 35 Award Spain' (2014
 ) and the European Young Researchers' Award (2013) for her work on applyin
 g technology for dyslexia using Linguistics\, HCI and NLP. Her IDEAL eBook
  reader and Dyseggxia game (Vodafone Foundation Mobile for Good Europe Awa
 rds 2013) have received nearly one hundred thousand downloads in more than
  70 countries. Currently\, she is working to detect dyslexia at large scal
 e and on bringing this work to society via her non-profit organization Cha

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Adam Fourney (Microsoft Research) - "Leveraging Sign
 als Generated From Search Engines and Web-based Resources"
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151014T120000

DESCRIPTION:<p>Search engines and web-based resources have become ubiquito
 us and essential tools for supporting the use of interactive systems. (e.g
 \, Microsoft PowerPoint\, Adobe Photoshop\, etc.) For example\, people rel
 y on web resources to learn new tasks\, troubleshoot problems\, or remind 
 themselves of key task details. This reliance on search engines and web-ba
 sed resources generates a rich set of signals that characterizes how the p
 opulation thinks about and uses software systems "in the wild\," on a day-
 to-day basis. </p>\n<p>In this talk\, I demonstrate how these signals can 
 be extracted and leveraged. Specifically\, I show how logs of online inter
 actions can be used to identify potential usability problems in any public
 ly available interactive system. I show how web tutorials can be used to m
 ap a broad user vocabulary to the narrow vocabulary expressed in a user in
 terface. Finally\, I demonstrate how web resources and software applicatio
 ns can mutually enhance each other by means of a shared interaction histor
 y. I conclude with an outline of my long-term research vision\, which cast
 s software applications\, web search\, and online support materials as int
 eroperating components of a larger holistic system to be studied\, designe
 d\, and evaluated in concert.</p>\n<p>Adam Fourney joined the MSR Context\
 , Learning\, and User Experience for Search (CLUES) research group in Sept
 ember of this year\, having recently earned his doctoral degree from the C
 heriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo\, working
  under the supervision of Dr. Michael Terry. Adam also holds a master's de
 gree from the University of Waterloo\, a bachelor's degree from the Univer
 sity of Ottawa\, and has interned on two occasions at Microsoft Research R
 edmond. Outside of his primary research interests\, Adam is an active deve
 loper in the Pebble smartwatch community.</p>

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Krzysztof Gajos (Harvard University) - "From Paid to
  Organic Crowdsourcing"
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151021T120000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151021T133000

DESCRIPTION:<p>Human computation systems seamlessly combine human percepti
 on\, creativity and knowledge with machine-driven algorithmic computation.
   Such systems have been demonstrated to accomplish tasks that could not p
 reviously be accomplished by either machines or by non-experts alone.  Con
 temporary human computation systems frequently recruit human contributions
  from online micro-labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.  While co
 nvenient\, this approach limits the scale\, scope and quality of work.</p>
 \n<p>In contrast\, my group's work has contributed to a largely unexplored
  area of "organic" crowdsourcing\, an area that builds on insights from so
 cial computing research and on recent advances in human computation.  In o
 rganic crowdsourcing\, intrinsically motivated people contribute to human 
 computation workflows as a byproduct of performing activities that they fi
 nd inherently valuable.  In successful organic crowdsourcing systems\, the
  addition of the human computation element enhances (instead of detracting
  from) the main activity\, while also resulting in useful work being done.
   For example\, with our Crowdy system\, people learning from tutorial vid
 eos get prompted with short quizzes. The quizzes are designed such that by
  answering them\, people contribute to a workflow that improves those same
  videos for future learners.  The quizzes are also designed to be pedagogi
 cally valuable.  The results of our study show that the improvements to th
 e tutorial videos generated by Crowdy are comparable in quality to those p
 roduced by experts.  Our results also demonstrate that people who view tut
 orial videos with Crowdy and participate in quizzes learn more than people
  who watch the same videos with a traditional video interface.  I will pre
 sent three organic crowdsourcing projects from our group and share an init
 ial synthesis of generalizable principles for the design of organic crowds
 ourcing systems.</p>\n<p>Krzysztof Gajos is an associate professor of Comp
 uter Science at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Scie
 nces. Krzysztof is broadly interested in intelligent interactive systems\,
  a research area that bridges artificial intelligence and human-computer i
 nteraction. Recent projects pursued by his group contributed to diverse ar
 eas such as personalized adaptive user interfaces\, systems for supporting
  collective creativity\, organic crowdsourcing\, large-scale experimentati
 on in the wild\, and learning technologies.</p>\n<p>Prior to arriving at H
 arvard\, Krzysztof was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research. He
  received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington and his M.Eng. and B
 .Sc. degrees from MIT. In the Fall of 2005\, he was visiting faculty at th
 e Ashesi University in Accra\, Ghana\, where he taught Introduction to Art
 ificial Intelligence. Krzysztof is a coeditor-in-chief of the ACM Transact
 ions on Interactive Intelligent Systems. He is a recipient of a Sloan Rese

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Been Kim (Computer Science & Engineering) - "Interac
 tive and Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Human Machine Collabora
 tion"
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151028T120000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151028T133000

DESCRIPTION:<p>I envision a system that enables successful collaborations 
 between humans and machine learning models by harnessing the relative stre
 ngth to accomplish what neither can do alone. Machine learning techniques 
 and humans have skills that complement each other --- machine learning tec
 hniques are good at computation on data at the lowest level of granularity
 \, whereas people are better at abstracting knowledge from their experienc
 e\, and transferring the knowledge across domains. The goal of my research
  is to develop a framework for human-in-the-loop machine learning that ena
 bles people to interact effectively with machine learning models to make b
 etter decisions using large datasets\, without requiring in-depth knowledg
 e about machine learning techniques.</p>\n<p>In this talk\, I present the 
 Bayesian Case Model (BCM)\, a general framework for Bayesian case-based re
 asoning (CBR) and prototype classification and clustering. BCM brings the 
 intuitive power of CBR to a Bayesian generative framework. The BCM learns 
 prototypes\, the "quintessential" observations that best represent cluster
 s in a dataset\, by performing joint inference on cluster labels\, prototy
 pes and important features. Simultaneously\, BCM pursues sparsity by learn
 ing subspaces\, the sets of features that play important roles in the char
 acterization of the prototypes. The prototype and subspace representation 
 provides quantitative benefits in interpretability while preserving classi
 fication accuracy. Human subject experiments verify statistically signific
 ant improvements to participants' understanding when using explanations pr
 oduced by BCM\, compared to those given by prior art. I demonstrate the ap
 plication of this model for an educational domain in which teachers cluste
 r programming assignments to streamline the grading process. </p>\n<p>Been
  Kim is a Research Scientist at AI2. She is also an affiliated faculty in 
 the Department of Computer Science &amp\; Engineering at the University of
  Washington. Her research focuses on interactive and interpretable machine
  learning models for human-machine collaboration. She received her PhD. fr
 om MIT. Prior to her PhD\, she worked at the MathWorks as a software engin

DESCRIPTION:<p>In this talk\, I explore the higher dimensions of touch inp
 ut. I show how to enable mobile devices to sense 3D information about the 
 space above them from just the touch input they observe. I present a serie
 s of touchscreen devices that capture users' fingerprints upon touch\, fro
 m which they conclude 3D information. Just like camera-based 3D tracking s
 ystems provide the opportunity for more natural and expressive interaction
 \, deriving such information from touch provides similar benefits. While c
 amera-based systems require a certain distance between sensor and tracked 
 objects\, however\, touchscreens sense information directly on their surfa
 ce\, which allows them to remain thin--the form factor that has allowed su
 ch devices to achieve mobility and mass-adoption in the first place. I dem
 onstrate that reconstructing 3D information from touch enables devices to 
 increase their input accuracy by a factor of three compared to current dev
 ices and I show that fingerprint-sensing touchscreens solve a long-standin
 g challenge in HCI: biometric user identification. I conclude with a new m
 odel of user authentication on touch devices\, demonstrate how to implemen
 t seamless biometric authentication on commodity devices\, and discuss the
  implications of this model on existing operating systems and their user i
 nterfaces. </p>\n<p>Christian Holz is a researcher in Human-Computer Inter
 action at Microsoft Research\, Redmond. His research focuses on augmenting
  the capabilities of existing mobile devices as well as creating new devic
 es to enrich the sensing capabilities of today's devices. Technology Revie
 w recently named Christian one of the 10 best innovators under 35 in Germa

DESCRIPTION:<p>League of Legends is an online game with over 67 million pl
 ayers playing the game every month. As the developer of League of Legends\
 , Riot Games has been employing the latest research from social and cognit
 ive psychology mixed with techniques like machine learning and game design
  to help create more positive online communities.</p>\n<p>One example of s
 uch research was the Tribunal System\; this experimental system automatica
 lly curated behaviors such as chat logs from online communities into "case
  files" that could be reviewed by players in League of Legends. Depending 
 on the case verdict\, the players under review would receive rewards or pu
 nishments for their behaviors. This system collects over 105 million trial
 s of data a year in just North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>In a second exa
 mple\, we will show how you can utilize machine learning to study the evol
 ution of language\, and how feedback from the system can be used as an int
 ervention to curb negative online behaviors. Finally\, we will discuss an 
 experiment where we explored what happens when you deploy a simple priming
  experiment to 67 million players over 4 weeks.</p>\n<p>Using online platf
 orms as a medium for research\, many fields of psychology could be on the 
 verge of a breakthrough. In the past year\, we have started collaborations
  with academic institutions to study cooperation and collective intelligen
 ce\, online governance\, the evolution of language and more. We want to sh
 ow you how online video games can forever change how we think about resear
 ch and how your lab can get involved. </p>\n<p>Jeffrey "Lyte" Lin is lead 
 game designer of social systems and is responsible for helping League of L
 egends have the most sportsmanlike community in online games. Dr. Lin and 
 his team challenge the convention that online communities are and always w
 ill be toxic environments\; in fact\, some of the team's latest work sugge
 sts that the vast majority of online communities are positive or neutral. 
 He runs experiments and data analyses\, translating the results and learni
 ngs into viable game features that enhance engagement while amplifying the
  sportsmanlike behavior that already exists in the community. Before Riot\
 , Jeffrey was an experimental psychologist at Valve Software and received 
 his Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience from the University of Washington with
  Dr. Geoffrey Boynton and Dr. Scott Murray.  </p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>An estimated 95% of our scientific knowledge about people\,
  their behavior\, perception\, and preferences is based on studies with "W
 EIRD" samples\, an acronym for participants who are Western\, Educated\, I
 ndustrialized\, Rich\, and Democratic. My work in Human-Computer Interacti
 on has shown that technology developed for WEIRD users\, based on knowledg
 e that is derived from studies with mostly US-based student populations\, 
 is often misaligned with the preferences\, behaviors\, and abilities of a 
 large proportion of the world's population: Users differ in how they perce
 ive information\, what they find appealing\, and what they can work with m
 ost efficiently. </p>\n<p>A possible solution to the conventional "one siz
 e fits all" approach is to predict what a user likes and works with most e
 fficiently\, and to leverage this knowledge to design user interfaces acco
 rdingly. In this talk\, I will showhow the online experiment platform Labi
 ntheWild (www.labinthewild.org) has enabled me to conduct large-scale beha
 vioralexperiments needed to build such predictive models. LabintheWild ena
 bles participants to compare themselves to others in exchange for study pa
 rticipation\; a feedback mechanism that has attracted an average of 1\,000
  participantsa day from more than 200 countries and various demographic gr

DESCRIPTION:<p>Computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools and social medi
 a potentially allow people to interact fluidly across national\, cultural 
 and linguistic boundaries in ways that would have been difficult if not im
 possible in the past. To date\, however\, however\, much of this potential
  fails to be realized. A single individual is unlikely to be fluent in a w
 ide array of languages. The use of a lingua franca such as English permits
  a degree of interaction with speakers of other native languages\, but it 
 can have negative effects on non-native speakers. Advances in machine tran
 slation (MT) and other technologies could allow people to communicate with
  one another in their native language\, but translation errors can create 
 sizeable misunderstandings when MT is used in conversational settings.  </
 p>\n<p>In a series of studies\, my students and I have been exploring the 
 problem space of inter-lingual communication\, with the goals of better un
 derstanding the challenges of interaction across language boundaries and o
 f informing the design of new tools to support this interaction.  I will f
 irst describe two interview studies exploring how the need to use a non-na
 tive language affects communication and coordination in both formal and in
 formal settings. I will then describe several tools we have developed to m
 ake MT more usable in everyday conversation and present the results of lab
  studies evaluating these tools.  Taken together\, these studies help help
  advance the area of inter-lingual computer-mediated communication. </p>\n

DESCRIPTION:<p>Crowd-sourcing labor markets (e.g.\, Amazon Mechanical Turk
 ) are booming\, because they enable rapid construction of complex workflow
 s that seamlessly mix human computation with computer automation. Example 
 applications range from photo tagging to audio-visual transcription and in
 terlingual translation. Similarly\, workflows on citizen science sites (e.
 g. GalaxyZoo) have allowed ordinary people to pool their effort and make i
 nteresting discoveries. Unfortunately\, constructing a good workflow is di
 fficult\, because the quality of the work performed by humans is highly va
 riable. Typically\, a task designer will experiment with several alternati
 ve workflows to accomplish a task\, varying the amount of redundant labor\
 , until she devises a control strategy that delivers acceptable performanc
 e.</p>\n<p>Fortunately\, this control challenge can often be formulated as
  an automated planning problem ripe for algorithms from the probabilistic 
 planning and reinforcement learning literature. I describe our recent work
  on the decision-theoretic control of crowd sourcing and suggest open prob
 lems for future research. In particular\, I discuss:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The us
 e of partially-observable Markov decision Processes (POMDPs) to control vo
 ting on binary-choice questions and iterative improvement workflows.</li>\
 n<li>Decision-theoretic methods that dynamically switch between alternativ
 e workflows in a way that improves on traditional (static) A-B testing.</l
 i>\n<li>A novel workflow for crowdsourcing the construction of a taxonomy 
 — a challenging problem since it demands a global perspective of the inp
 ut data when no one worker sees more than a tiny fraction.</li>\n<li>Metho
 ds for optimizing the acquisition of labeled training data for use in mach
 ine learning applications\; this an important special case\, since data an
 notation is often crowd-sourced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Daniel S. Weld is Thomas

DESCRIPTION:<p>Surgical telemedicine has emerged as a promising answer to 
 the increasing needs of everyday surgical collaboration and in situ educat
 ion. The implicit desire is to allow a remote surgeon to see the body as t
 he local surgeon does in order to engage in shared decision-making or inst
 ruction. With this talk I take a step back by discussing the productive an
 d cross-referential nature of surgical practice and image use. I discuss h
 ow it is not simply a case of transferring recorded video\, but rather a n
 ew practice is instantiated in creating a view of the body for the remote 
 surgeon. In order to investigate these practices for capturing and using v
 ideo\, I deployed a head-mounted video camera (via the Google Glass) in si
 x transplant organ recovery assessments. Drawing on observations and analy
 sis of the video artifacts\, I examine how the transmitting surgeon crafts
  a view for the remote surgeon in order to facilitate the co-construction 
 of knowledge and shared decision making.  I use these findings to discuss 
 further design directions for video use in surgical telemedicine.</p>\n<p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>An approach for studying how individuals learn and use part

 hooter expertise outperform novices on specifictypes of cognition tasks. G
 iven the rapid growth in popularity of multiplayer online battle arena (MO
 BA) games (e.g.\, Dota 2\, Leagueof Legends) we investigated whether simil
 ar connections would be observed with this gamer population. In doing so w
 e addressed: (i)whether a sample of experienced gamers and valid cognitive
  task data could be collected at a MOBA tournament\, (ii) whetherindividua
 l differences in cognitive skills are connected to MOBA expertise\, (iii) 
 how MOBA expertise effects line up with previousresearch. Our results sugg
 est that gaming tournaments should be considered for gathering a large sam
 ple of experienced gamers andthat specific cognitive skills are connected 
 to MOBA expertise. We conclude that MOBAs offer a unique perspective for e
 xamining howexperience with an online game genre that has complex gameplay

DESCRIPTION:<p>The goal of my research is to reduce technical barriers to 
 creative expression\, with a focus on audio and music. Digital audio produ
 ction tools (the audio-equivalents to Photoshop) used to make music record
 ings are typically controlled using low-level technical parameters\, imita
 ting their analog counterparts from forty years ago. Learning the mapping 
 between creative intent ("give me a &lt\;ka-CHUNK&gt\;") and these low-lev
 el parameter setting requires considerable knowledge and experience\, disc
 ouraging many from using the tools. In my research\, I fundamentally rethi
 nk the interaction paradigm of audio production tools. My research allows 
 users to communicate using natural methods similar to how one typically co
 mmunicates audio ideas to another human—e.g. using descriptive language\
 , vocal imitation\, examples\, and evaluative feedback. Using these method
 s\, even novice users can realize and explore creative ideas\, letting the
 m overcome hurdles such as limited technical knowledge and experience with
  the tools. In this talk\, I present systems that implement these interact
 ion approaches and experiments that explore the strengths and limitations 
 of these approaches.</p>\n<p>Mark Cartwright is a Chicago-based computer s

 by offering a methodological framework to enhanceempathy and bridge gaps b
 etween designers and consumers\, but this still results in products and se

DESCRIPTION:<p>As streams of trace data about information work have prolif
 erated\, the challenges of personal information management have become inc
 reasingly complex and difficult — with personal information streams frag
 mented across devices and removed from the site of work\, for example\, on
 e’s ability to make sense of this trace data and use it productively to 
 improve knowledge work has become work in its own right. In this talk\, I 
 present research that begins to explore two related challenges: (1) unders
 tanding the ways in which knowledge workers are — and are not — motiva
 ted to interact with various representations of their trace data\, and (2)
  understanding how to manifest trace data in the work environment in ways 
 that make it present/visible in the right time and the right place as well
  as being appropriable for helping individuals (and groups) improve their 
 knowledge work practices. I conclude by reflecting on steps forward at the
  intersection of these two challenges.</p>\n<p>Stephen Voida is an Assista

DESCRIPTION:<p>The applications we create are framed by the tools we use t
 o create them. On one hand\, tools codify effective practice and empower d
 esign. On the other\, that same codification eventually constrains design.
  My research examines new approaches to interactive systems in light of th
 is tradeoff\, often with an emphasis on unlocking existing codifications t
 o enable new designs. This talk will focus on three examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<
 li>I will first present our work on unlocking data with interactive machin
 e learning. Dominant models of interaction   fail to support expressivenes
 s and control in many emerging forms of everyday data. Exploring such doma
 ins as   web image search and gesture recognition\, our work shows how int
 eractive machine learning can support people   in extending the underlying
  language of an interaction.</li>\n<li>I will then present our work on usi
 ng pixel-based reverse engineering to unlock existing graphical interfaces
 \,   allowing runtime modification of those interfaces without their sourc
 e. Pixel-based methods allow prototyping   new possibilities atop the exis
 ting ecosystem of applications and tools\, accelerating innovation and inf
 orming   the next-generation ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Finally\, I will conside
 r how these challenges combine in the emergence of self-tracking and perso
 nal informatics.   Data is no longer a distant concept\, but an everyday b
 arrier to interaction\, self-knowledge\, and personal empowerment.   The t
 ools we create to support these applications will define the future of eve
 ryday interaction with personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given these examples
 \, I argue research must consider not only specific applications\, but als
 o the assumptions codified by underlying tools and how those tools frame o
 ur understanding of what application designs are even possible.</p>\n<p>Ja

 professional software developers in thefuture\; or 2) enhance their market
 ability in the software industry. I will also discuss results from our fol
 low up studythat confirms the existence of such a population of conversati

DESCRIPTION:<p>The convergence of social\, cloud and mobile computing has 
 created a world in which people generate\, access\, manipulate\, and share
  personal digital data at larger scales and faster rates than ever before.
  From digital photo albums to online music streaming services\, these new

 sions that capture their life experiences. While these technological trend
 s have created many opportunities\, they also raise complex questions for 
 the HCI community as we critically look to the future and consider their l
 onger-term implications. As archives continue to grow\, how will people li
 ve with their virtual possessions in ways that support their evolving prac
 tices\, values\, and understandings of self? How might people’s relation
 s to digital data and the technologies that manifest them change over time
 ? What kinds of qualities should designers consider in crafting a longer-t
 erm place for computational things in everyday life? In this talk I will d
 raw on examples from my research to motivate these questions as a crucial 
 research space for the HCI community. I will then give an overview of my r

DESCRIPTION:<p>Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous but are not a
 s yet all fully driverless. Autonomous technology is being introduced in p
 hases. This requires human drivers to continually adapt to their changing 
 role inside the car. The human’s ability to decide when to take back con
 trol of the primary driving task is further complicated given system imper
 fections. As drivers adapt to increasing levels of automation\, they may c
 hange their driving behaviour in ways that can compromise and even negate 
 the intended system benefits. To design vehicles that account for limitati
 ons of both the human and the system\, it is essential to model such behav
 ioural adaptation. This presentation will focus on the challenges and oppo

  to require knowledge of accessibility best practices in their job descrip

DESCRIPTION:<p>Emotions play an important role in our everyday lives. They
  influence memory\, decision-making and well-being.  In order to advance t
 he fundamental understanding of human emotions\, build smarter affective t
 echnology\, and ultimately help people\, we need to perform research in-si
 tu. It is now possible to quantify emotional responses on a large scale us
 ing webcams and wearable devices in everyday environments. I will present 
 work on state-of-the-art automated facial expression recognition tools and
  insights from analysis from the world’s largest dataset of naturalistic
  emotional responses (featuring examples from millions of individuals). I'
 ll show examples of how this data has allowed us to corroborate and extend
  the understanding of nonverbal behavior\, including modeling gender and c
 ultural differences in expression (and what makes a viral video). I'll pre
 sent methods for remotely measuring physiology using webcams that allow lo
 w-cost and highly scalable measurement of cardio-pulmonary activity includ
 ing heart rate variability allowing us to capture sympathetic nervous syst
 em activity in addition to expressions. Finally\, I will discuss how this 
 work will help us bring emotional intelligence to everyday digital devices
  and potentially track important health conditions. </p>\n<p><a href="http

DESCRIPTION:<p>ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a degenerative neuro
 muscular disease\; people with late-stage ALS typically retain cognitive f
 unction\, but lose the motor ability to speak\, relying on gaze-controlled
  AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) devices for interpersona
 l interactions. State-of-the-art AAC technologies used by people with ALS 
 do not facilitate natural communication\; gaze-based AAC communication is 
 extremely slow (typically below 20 wpm\, compared to 190 wpm for conversat
 ional speech)\, and the resulting synthesized speech is flat and robotic. 
 In this talk\, I will present a series of novel technology prototypes from
  the Microsoft Research Enable team that aim to address the challenges of 
 improving the throughput and expressivity of AAC for people with ALS.  </p
