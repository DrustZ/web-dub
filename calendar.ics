DESCRIPTION:More than 10% of the population has dyslexia\, and most are di
 agnosed only after they fail in school. My work is \nchanging this through
  scalable early detection and tools that help people with dyslexia read an
 d write better. To \ndetect dyslexia\, I am developing machine learning mo
 dels that predict reading and writing difficulties by watching \nhow peopl
 e interact with my web-based game Dytective. My experiments have revealed 
 differences in how people with \ndyslexia read and write\, and I have deve
 loped a series of tools that integrate these results to help people with \
 ndyslexia read and write better. These tools are used by tens of thousands
  of people\, which apart from supporting \nusers\, also serve as living la
 boratories in which to develop and prove techniques for detection and inte
 rvention. \nMoving forward\, we are working with schools to put our approa
 ch into practice at scale to finally eliminate school \nfailure as a prima
 ry way dyslexia is diagnosed.\n\nLuz Rello is a Post Doctoral Fellow at Ca
 rnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. She 
 is \nalso an Ashoka Fellow\, invited expert to W3C-WAI and co-founder of t
 he Cookie Cloud team that creates applications \nfrom research results. Sh
 e holds a degree in Linguistics (Complutense University of Madrid)\, a MSc
  in Natural \nLanguage Processing (University of Wolverhampton) and a Ph.D
 . in Computer Science (Pompeu Fabra University). She has \nreceived a numb
 er of awards\, including the MIT Technology Review 'Innovators under 35 Aw
 ard Spain' (2014) and the \nEuropean Young Researchers' Award (2013) for h
 er work on applying technology for dyslexia using Linguistics\, HCI and \n
 NLP. Her IDEAL eBook reader and Dyseggxia game (Vodafone Foundation Mobile
  for Good Europe Awards 2013) have received \nnearly one hundred thousand 
 downloads in more than 70 countries. Currently\, she is working to detect 
 dyslexia at \nlarge scale and on bringing this work to society via her non
 -profit organization Change Dyslexia.\n

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Adam Fourney (Microsoft Research) - "Leveraging Sign
 als Generated From Search Engines and Web-based Resources"
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151014T120000

DESCRIPTION:Search engines and web-based resources have become ubiquitous 
 and essential tools for supporting the use of \ninteractive systems. (e.g\
 , Microsoft PowerPoint\, Adobe Photoshop\, etc.) For example\, people rely
  on web resources to \nlearn new tasks\, troubleshoot problems\, or remind
  themselves of key task details. This reliance on search engines and \nweb
 -based resources generates a rich set of signals that characterizes how th
 e population thinks about and uses \nsoftware systems "in the wild\," on a
  day-to-day basis. \n\nIn this talk\, I demonstrate how these signals can 
 be extracted and leveraged. Specifically\, I show how logs of online \nint
 eractions can be used to identify potential usability problems in any publ
 icly available interactive system. I \nshow how web tutorials can be used 
 to map a broad user vocabulary to the narrow vocabulary expressed in a use
 r \ninterface. Finally\, I demonstrate how web resources and software appl
 ications can mutually enhance each other by \nmeans of a shared interactio
 n history. I conclude with an outline of my long-term research vision\, wh
 ich casts \nsoftware applications\, web search\, and online support materi
 als as interoperating components of a larger holistic \nsystem to be studi
 ed\, designed\, and evaluated in concert.\n\nAdam Fourney joined the MSR C
 ontext\, Learning\, and User Experience for Search (CLUES) research group 
 in September of \nthis year\, having recently earned his doctoral degree f
 rom the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University \nof Waterlo
 o\, working under the supervision of Dr. Michael Terry. Adam also holds a 
 master's degree from the \nUniversity of Waterloo\, a bachelor's degree fr
 om the University of Ottawa\, and has interned on two occasions at \nMicro
 soft Research Redmond. Outside of his primary research interests\, Adam is
  an active developer in the Pebble \nsmartwatch community.\n

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Krzysztof Gajos (Harvard University) - "From Paid to
  Organic Crowdsourcing"
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151021T120000

DESCRIPTION:Human computation systems seamlessly combine human perception\
 , creativity and knowledge with machine-driven \nalgorithmic computation. 
  Such systems have been demonstrated to accomplish tasks that could not pr
 eviously be \naccomplished by either machines or by non-experts alone.  Co
 ntemporary human computation systems frequently recruit \nhuman contributi
 ons from online micro-labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.  While
  convenient\, this approach \nlimits the scale\, scope and quality of work
 .\n\nIn contrast\, my group's work has contributed to a largely unexplored
  area of "organic" crowdsourcing\, an area that \nbuilds on insights from 
 social computing research and on recent advances in human computation.  In
  organic \ncrowdsourcing\, intrinsically motivated people contribute to hu
 man computation workflows as a byproduct of performing \nactivities that t
 hey find inherently valuable.  In successful organic crowdsourcing systems
 \, the addition of the \nhuman computation element enhances (instead of de
 tracting from) the main activity\, while also resulting in useful \nwork b
 eing done.  For example\, with our Crowdy system\, people learning from tu
 torial videos get prompted with short \nquizzes. The quizzes are designed 
 such that by answering them\, people contribute to a workflow that improve
 s those \nsame videos for future learners.  The quizzes are also designed 
 to be pedagogically valuable.  The results of our \nstudy show that the im
 provements to the tutorial videos generated by Crowdy are comparable in qu
 ality to those \nproduced by experts.  Our results also demonstrate that p
 eople who view tutorial videos with Crowdy and participate \nin quizzes le
 arn more than people who watch the same videos with a traditional video in
 terface.  I will present three \norganic crowdsourcing projects from our g
 roup and share an initial synthesis of generalizable principles for the \n
 design of organic crowdsourcing systems.\n\nKrzysztof Gajos is an associat
 e professor of Computer Science at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineeri
 ng and \nApplied Sciences. Krzysztof is broadly interested in intelligent 
 interactive systems\, a research area that bridges \nartificial intelligen
 ce and human-computer interaction. Recent projects pursued by his group co
 ntributed to diverse \nareas such as personalized adaptive user interfaces
 \, systems for supporting collective creativity\, organic \ncrowdsourcing\
 , large-scale experimentation in the wild\, and learning technologies.\n\n
 Prior to arriving at Harvard\, Krzysztof was a postdoctoral researcher at 
 Microsoft Research. He received his Ph.D. \nfrom the University of Washing
 ton and his M.Eng. and B.Sc. degrees from MIT. In the Fall of 2005\, he wa
 s visiting \nfaculty at the Ashesi University in Accra\, Ghana\, where he 
 taught Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Krzysztof \nis a coeditor-
 in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems. He is
  a recipient of a Sloan \nResearch Fellowship.\n

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Been Kim (Computer Science & Engineering) - "Interac
 tive and Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Human Machine Collabora
 tion"
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20151028T120000

DESCRIPTION:I envision a system that enables successful collaborations bet
 ween humans and machine learning models by harnessing \nthe relative stren
 gth to accomplish what neither can do alone. Machine learning techniques a
 nd humans have skills \nthat complement each other --- machine learning te
 chniques are good at computation on data at the lowest level of \ngranular
 ity\, whereas people are better at abstracting knowledge from their experi
 ence\, and transferring the knowledge \nacross domains. The goal of my res
 earch is to develop a framework for human-in-the-loop machine learning tha
 t enables \npeople to interact effectively with machine learning models to
  make better decisions using large datasets\, without \nrequiring in-depth
  knowledge about machine learning techniques.\n\nIn this talk\, I present 
 the Bayesian Case Model (BCM)\, a general framework for Bayesian case-base
 d reasoning (CBR) \nand prototype classification and clustering. BCM bring
 s the intuitive power of CBR to a Bayesian generative \nframework. The BCM
  learns prototypes\, the "quintessential" observations that best represent
  clusters in a dataset\, by \nperforming joint inference on cluster labels
 \, prototypes and important features. Simultaneously\, BCM pursues sparsit
 y \nby learning subspaces\, the sets of features that play important roles
  in the characterization of the prototypes. The \nprototype and subspace r
 epresentation provides quantitative benefits in interpretability while pre
 serving \nclassification accuracy. Human subject experiments verify statis
 tically significant improvements to participants' \nunderstanding when usi
 ng explanations produced by BCM\, compared to those given by prior art. I 
 demonstrate the \napplication of this model for an educational domain in w
 hich teachers cluster programming assignments to streamline \nthe grading 
 process. \n\nBeen Kim is a Research Scientist at AI2. She is also an affil
 iated faculty in the Department of Computer Science & \nEngineering at the
  University of Washington. Her research focuses on interactive and interpr
 etable machine learning \nmodels for human-machine collaboration. She rece
 ived her PhD. from MIT. Prior to her PhD\, she worked at the MathWorks \na
 s a software engineer.\n

DESCRIPTION:In this talk\, I explore the higher dimensions of touch input.
  I show how to enable mobile devices to sense 3D \ninformation about the s
 pace above them from just the touch input they observe. I present a series
  of touchscreen \ndevices that capture users' fingerprints upon touch\, fr
 om which they conclude 3D information. Just like camera-based \n3D trackin
 g systems provide the opportunity for more natural and expressive interact
 ion\, deriving such information \nfrom touch provides similar benefits. Wh
 ile camera-based systems require a certain distance between sensor and \nt
 racked objects\, however\, touchscreens sense information directly on thei
 r surface\, which allows them to remain \nthin--the form factor that has a
 llowed such devices to achieve mobility and mass-adoption in the first pla
 ce. I \ndemonstrate that reconstructing 3D information from touch enables 
 devices to increase their input accuracy by a \nfactor of three compared t
 o current devices and I show that fingerprint-sensing touchscreens solve a
  long-standing \nchallenge in HCI: biometric user identification. I conclu
 de with a new model of user authentication on touch devices\, \ndemonstrat
 e how to implement seamless biometric authentication on commodity devices\
 , and discuss the implications of \nthis model on existing operating syste
 ms and their user interfaces. \n\nChristian Holz is a researcher in Human-
 Computer Interaction at Microsoft Research\, Redmond. His research focuses
  on \naugmenting the capabilities of existing mobile devices as well as cr
 eating new devices to enrich the sensing \ncapabilities of today's devices
 . Technology Review recently named Christian one of the 10 best innovators
  under 35 in \nGermany and his work has received honorable mentions at ACM
  CHI and a best paper award at ACM UIST. Christian holds a \nPh.D. in Huma
 n-Computer Interaction and masters and bachelor degrees in Software Engine

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Jeffrey Lin (Riot Games) - "67 million trials in 4 w

DESCRIPTION:League of Legends is an online game with over 67 million playe
 rs playing the game every month. As the developer of \nLeague of Legends\,
  Riot Games has been employing the latest research from social and cogniti
 ve psychology mixed with \ntechniques like machine learning and game desig
 n to help create more positive online communities.\n\nOne example of such 
 research was the Tribunal System\; this experimental system automatically 
 curated behaviors such \nas chat logs from online communities into "case f
 iles" that could be reviewed by players in League of Legends. \nDepending 
 on the case verdict\, the players under review would receive rewards or pu
 nishments for their behaviors. \nThis system collects over 105 million tri
 als of data a year in just North America and Europe.\n\nIn a second exampl
 e\, we will show how you can utilize machine learning to study the evoluti
 on of language\, and how \nfeedback from the system can be used as an inte
 rvention to curb negative online behaviors. Finally\, we will discuss \nan
  experiment where we explored what happens when you deploy a simple primin
 g experiment to 67 million players over 4 \nweeks.\n\nUsing online platfor
 ms as a medium for research\, many fields of psychology could be on the ve
 rge of a breakthrough. \nIn the past year\, we have started collaborations
  with academic institutions to study cooperation and collective \nintellig
 ence\, online governance\, the evolution of language and more. We want to 
 show you how online video games can \nforever change how we think about re
 search and how your lab can get involved. \n\nJeffrey "Lyte" Lin is lead g
 ame designer of social systems and is responsible for helping League of Le
 gends have the \nmost sportsmanlike community in online games. Dr. Lin and
  his team challenge the convention that online communities \nare and alway
 s will be toxic environments\; in fact\, some of the team's latest work su
 ggests that the vast majority of \nonline communities are positive or neut
 ral. He runs experiments and data analyses\, translating the results and \
 nlearnings into viable game features that enhance engagement while amplify
 ing the sportsmanlike behavior that already \nexists in the community. Bef
 ore Riot\, Jeffrey was an experimental psychologist at Valve Software and 
 received his \nPh.D. in cognitive neuroscience from the University of Wash
 ington with Dr. Geoffrey Boynton and Dr. Scott Murray.  \n

DESCRIPTION:An estimated 95% of our scientific knowledge about people\, th
 eir behavior\, perception\, and preferences is based on \nstudies with "WE
 IRD" samples\, an acronym for participants who are Western\, Educated\, In
 dustrialized\, Rich\, and Democratic. \nMy work in Human-Computer Interact
 ion has shown that technology developed for WEIRD users\, based on knowled
 ge that is \nderived from studies with mostly US-based student populations
 \, is often misaligned with the preferences\, behaviors\, \nand abilities 
 of a large proportion of the world's population: Users differ in how they 
 perceive information\, what \nthey find appealing\, and what they can work
  with most efficiently. \n\nA possible solution to the conventional "one s
 ize fits all" approach is to predict what a user likes and works with \nmo
 st efficiently\, and to leverage this knowledge to design user interfaces 
 accordingly. In this talk\, I will show\nhow the online experiment platfor
 m LabintheWild (www.labinthewild.org) has enabled me to conduct large-scal
 e behavioral\nexperiments needed to build such predictive models. Labinthe
 Wild enables participants to compare themselves to \nothers in exchange fo
 r study participation\; a feedback mechanism that has attracted an average
  of 1\,000 participants\na day from more than 200 countries and various de
 mographic groups. I show how LabintheWild experiments have enabled me\nto 
 study less WEIRD users than possible in conventional laboratory studies\, 
 and how the results of these studies allowed\nme to build systems that pre
 dict what users like. \n\nKatharina Reinecke is an assistant professor in 
 the Computer Science & Engineering department at the University of \nWashi
 ngton. Prior to that\, she was an assistant professor at the University of
  Michigan School of Information and the \nDepartment of Computer Science. 
 She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Zurich\,
  Switzerland\,\nand spent her postdoctoral years at the Harvard School of 
 Engineering and Applied Sciences. Her research in human-computer\ninteract
 ion focuses on understanding how culture affects users' perception\, behav
 ior\, and preferences when interacting\nwith technology. Using data from h
 er online experiment platform LabintheWild.org\, she builds systems that p
 redict the\nsuitability of user interfaces for people around the world. Ka
 tharina has received Best Paper awards and nominations\nat premier venues

DESCRIPTION:The imperative to inspire young students\, especially under-re
 presented minorities and women\, to pursue education and \ncareers in STE(
 A)M (Science\, Technology\, Engineering\, (Art)\, and Math) fields is well
  known. The burning question is \nhow to do it effectively.\n\nFor the pas
 t few years\, we have been using a design activity known as a charrette as
  a way to introduce students to \nthe user-centered design (UCD) process. 
 In our "UCD Charrette\," students are given a particular design space to \
 nexplore (such as user interfaces for a web site\, mobile app\, or a physi
 cal device). In a very short period of time \n(two hours or less)\, workin
 g in small groups\, they brainstorm user needs\, develop use-case scenario
 s\, and create and \npresent interaction designs for an application. We ha
 ve run these participatory workshops with students at various \nlevels\, f
 rom middle school to graduate programs.\n\nIn this talk\, we will report o
 n our recent experiences using our UCD Charrette in a variety of outreach 
 efforts\, most \nespecially a number of Puget Sound high schools.\n\nAndre

DESCRIPTION:Computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools and social media p
 otentially allow people to interact fluidly across \nnational\, cultural a
 nd linguistic boundaries in ways that would have been difficult if not imp
 ossible in the past. \nTo date\, however\, however\, much of this potentia
 l fails to be realized. A single individual is unlikely to be \nfluent in 
 a wide array of languages. The use of a lingua franca such as English perm
 its a degree of interaction \nwith speakers of other native languages\, bu
 t it can have negative effects on non-native speakers. Advances in \nmachi
 ne translation (MT) and other technologies could allow people to communica
 te with one another in their native \nlanguage\, but translation errors ca
 n create sizeable misunderstandings when MT is used in conversational sett
 ings.  \n\nIn a series of studies\, my students and I have been exploring 
 the problem space of inter-lingual communication\, \nwith the goals of bet
 ter understanding the challenges of interaction across language boundaries
  and of informing \nthe design of new tools to support this interaction.  
 I will first describe two interview studies exploring how the \nneed to us
 e a non-native language affects communication and coordination in both for
 mal and informal settings. I \nwill then describe several tools we have de
 veloped to make MT more usable in everyday conversation and present the \n
 results of lab studies evaluating these tools.  Taken together\, these stu
 dies help help advance the area of \ninter-lingual computer-mediated commu
 nication. \n\nSusan R. Fussell is a Professor in the Department of Communi
 cation and the Department of of Information Science at \nCornell Universit

 rsity\, and her Ph.D. in \nsocial and cognitive psychology from Columbia U
 niversity. Dr. Fussell's primary interests lie in the areas of \ncomputer-
 supported cooperative work and computer-mediated communication. Her curren

 borative intelligence analysis\, public deliberation\, and tools \nto moti

DESCRIPTION:Crowd-sourcing labor markets (e.g.\, Amazon Mechanical Turk) a
 re booming\, because they enable rapid construction of complex workflows t
 hat seamlessly mix human computation with computer automation. Example app
 lications range from photo tagging to audio-visual transcription and inter
 lingual translation. Similarly\, workflows on citizen science sites (e.g. 
 GalaxyZoo) have allowed ordinary people to pool their effort and make inte
 resting discoveries. Unfortunately\, constructing a good workflow is diffi
 cult\, because the quality of the work performed by humans is highly varia
 ble. Typically\, a task designer will experiment with several alternative 
 workflows to accomplish a task\, varying the amount of redundant labor\, u
 ntil she devises a control strategy that delivers acceptable performance.\
 n\nFortunately\, this control challenge can often be formulated as an auto
 mated planning problem ripe for algorithms from the probabilistic planning
  and reinforcement learning literature. I describe our recent work on the 
 decision-theoretic control of crowd sourcing and suggest open problems for
  future research. In particular\, I discuss:\n\n* The use of partially-obs
 ervable Markov decision Processes (POMDPs) to control voting on binary-cho
 ice questions and iterative improvement workflows.\n* Decision-theoretic m
 ethods that dynamically switch between alternative workflows in a way that
  improves on traditional (static) A-B testing.\n* A novel workflow for cro
 wdsourcing the construction of a taxonomy — a challenging problem since 
 it demands a global perspective of the input data when no one worker sees 
 more than a tiny fraction.\n* Methods for optimizing the acquisition of la
 beled training data for use in machine learning applications\; this an imp
 ortant special case\, since data annotation is often crowd-sourced.\n\nDan

DESCRIPTION:After 20 years as a professor\, I started a company. I wasn't 
 commercializing any IP from my academic work. I wanted to build a company 
 that responded to a generalized problem that had been revealed through yea
 rs of academic research. \n\nIn this talk I'll address how the various asp

 s tasks like fundraising\, ideation\, prototyping\, and user testing\, as 
 well as less obvious processes like manufacturing\, marketing\, sales\, an

  of ways to build a company\, and I'll share the experience of building wi
 th a design perspective at the center of decision-making.\n\nCaution:  the
 re may be adult language involved.\n\nI'm a researcher\, educator\, and en
 trepreneur who blends disciplinary perspectives to identify hidden problem
 s and craft innovative solutions. I began my career as a professor in the 
 humanities\, studying how diverse communities used a then text-based Inter
 net to organize and enact change. After a decade of work on technology ado
 ption\, adaptation\, and usage patterns in low resource communities around
  the world\, I became a professor in engineering in order to collaborate o
 n building better solutions to intransigent problems. My current work focu
 ses on the potential of non-experts to create disruptive solutions\, and I
  build programs that help people become functional engineers so they can s
 olve problems in their communities.\n\nIn terms of actual job titles\, I a
 m a Professor of Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of 
 Washington where I co-direct the Tactical and Tactile Technology Lab (form
 erly the Design for Digital Inclusion lab).I am also co-founder and CEO of
  Shift Labs\, a company that builds simple medical devices that solve huge
  unmet problems at a price point global markets can afford. \n\nAt UW I al
 so created the Hackademia Project which builds innovation potential among 
 broad audiences by imparting functional engineering skills combined with d
 esign thinking. My technology development projects have included work on a
  low-cost ultrasound system for midwives in Uganda and a grassroots public
  transportation information system in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nI've been the Directo

DESCRIPTION:Surgical telemedicine has emerged as a promising answer to the
  increasing needs of everyday surgical collaboration \nand in situ educati
 on. The implicit desire is to allow a remote surgeon to see the body as th
 e local surgeon does in \norder to engage in shared decision-making or ins
 truction. With this talk I take a step back by discussing the \nproductive
  and cross-referential nature of surgical practice and image use. I discus
 s how it is not simply a case of \ntransferring recorded video\, but rathe
 r a new practice is instantiated in creating a view of the body for the re
 mote \nsurgeon. In order to investigate these practices for capturing and 
 using video\, I deployed a head-mounted video \ncamera (via the Google Gla
 ss) in six transplant organ recovery assessments. Drawing on observations 
 and analysis of \nthe video artifacts\, I examine how the transmitting sur
 geon crafts a view for the remote surgeon in order to \nfacilitate the co-
 construction of knowledge and shared decision making.  I use these finding
 s to discuss further \ndesign directions for video use in surgical telemed
 icine.\n\nHelena Mentis\, PhD\, is an assistant professor in the Departmen

DESCRIPTION:An approach for studying how individuals learn and use particu
 lar skill sets is to examine those who vary in expertise within a\nspecifi
 c field. Previous research has found that individuals with first-person sh
 ooter expertise outperform novices on specific\ntypes of cognition tasks. 
 Given the rapid growth in popularity of multiplayer online battle arena (M
 OBA) games (e.g.\, Dota 2\, League\nof Legends) we investigated whether si
 milar connections would be observed with this gamer population. In doing s
 o we addressed: (i)\nwhether a sample of experienced gamers and valid cogn
 itive task data could be collected at a MOBA tournament\, (ii) whether\nin
 dividual differences in cognitive skills are connected to MOBA expertise\,
  (iii) how MOBA expertise effects line up with previous\nresearch. Our res
 ults suggest that gaming tournaments should be considered for gathering a 
 large sample of experienced gamers and\nthat specific cognitive skills are
  connected to MOBA expertise. We conclude that MOBAs offer a unique perspe
 ctive for examining how\nexperience with an online game genre that has com
 plex gameplay and social interactions is connected to psychological proces
 ses.\n\nJustin Bonny is a research psychologist at foundry10 and is respon

DESCRIPTION:Constrained access to the Internet and communication technolog
 ies is commonly associated with social inequality. Policymakers in\nmany s
 ectors—and particularly\, in education—have placed their bets on incre
 ased access to technology having the potential to\nmitigate broader social
  disparities. The relationships between digital and social equity suggest 
 that meaningful connectivity—that\nis\, having the technical skills nece
 ssary to engage technology and mobilize digital resources to address every
 day needs—can empower\nsocially disenfranchised individuals\, families\,
  and communities. In the context of a national digital equity initiative\,
  this study\nexamines how parents and children of low-income Latino famili
 es incorporate new technologies into their everyday lives. Through a\ncomp
 arison of three demographically similar communities where discounted broad
 band is being offered\, we present a bottom-up\,\ncommunication-centered p
 erspective on a top-down technology policy. Our ecological approach consid
 ers the intersection of macro- and\nmeso-level factors that influence Lati
 no families’ perceptions of technology and that shape their consequent a
 doption and\nintegration decisions.\n\nCarmen Gonzalez is an assistant pro

 three times longer and create millions of false positives for censors--whi
 le\nremaining human-interpretable. Finally\, I will close the talk with a

DESCRIPTION:The goal of my research is to reduce technical barriers to cre
 ative expression\, with a focus on audio and music. \nDigital audio produc
 tion tools (the audio-equivalents to Photoshop) used to make music recordi
 ngs are typically controlled \nusing low-level technical parameters\, imit
 ating their analog counterparts from forty years ago. \nLearning the mappi
 ng between creative intent ("give me a &lt\;ka-CHUNK&gt\;") and these low-
 level parameter setting requires \nconsiderable knowledge and experience\,
  discouraging many from using the tools. \nIn my research\, I fundamentall
 y rethink the interaction paradigm of audio production tools. \nMy researc
 h allows users to communicate using natural methods similar to how one typ
 ically communicates \naudio ideas to another human—e.g. using descriptiv
 e language\, vocal imitation\, examples\, and evaluative feedback. \nUsing
  these methods\, even novice users can realize and explore creative ideas\
 , letting them overcome \nhurdles such as limited technical knowledge and 
 experience with the tools. \nIn this talk\, I present systems that impleme
 nt these interaction approaches and experiments \nthat explore the strengt
 hs and limitations of these approaches.\n\nMark Cartwright is a Chicago-ba
 sed computer scientist and musician. \nHe is a Ph.D. candidate in computer
  science at Northwestern University in Bryan Pardo's Interactive Audio Lab
 . \nHis research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction\, 
 audio signal processing\, and machine learning. \nIt focuses on creating n
 ew interfaces and tools for music production that support creativity by \n
 rethinking the traditional interaction paradigms. \nHe received a Bachelor
  of Music from Northwestern University and a Master of Arts from Stanford 
 University (CCRMA). \nHe won a National Science Foundation Graduate Resear
 ch Fellowship to fund his Ph.D. and \nwas a visiting researcher at the Cen

DESCRIPTION:Design is a discipline filled with Philosopher Kings\, holders
  of arcane knowledge who believe we're uniquely\nqualified to dazzle the m
 asses stuck in Plato's cave. We all live in the designed world\, and both 
 our\nmoment-to-moment experiences and our most personal conceptions of the
  self are shaped by the design\nexpression of others\; as designers we str
 ive to continuously interrogate our processes and motives to\nensure they 
 include rather than exclude\, uplift rather than denigrate\, and expand pe
 rsonal agency rather\nthan constrain it. Human-centered design supports ou
 r work by offering a methodological framework to enhance\nempathy and brid
 ge gaps between designers and consumers\, but this still results in produc
 ts and services filled\nwith translation errors and missed opportunities. 
 Most designers ultimately still believe we're Philosopher Kings\n(even if 
 we're loathe to admit it)\, and we still typically live a world away from 
 the personas we so diligently\ncreate. This discussion explores the need t
 o turn a human-centered lens upon ourselves\, and asks that we reject\nthe
  designer as Philosopher King model as we rush into a virtual world where 
 our experience of reality is even\nmore comprehensively provided by someon
 e else.\n\nJason Pace is the Executive Director of the University of Washi

 user experience and product development teams on a number of Microsoft's c
 onsumer\nproducts\, and his work in the DFL explores how radically diverse
  teams (teams that intentionally seek\nto maximize individual differences 
 across a broad spectrum of backgrounds) can lead to unexpected insights\,\
 nnew directions in product development\, and increased efficiency. The lab

 the impact of stress increasing the risk for mental and physical illnesses
  for teens.\nResearchers lack quality data to understand how\, when and wh

  look like. To gain a deeper understanding of teen stress\, our team is de
 veloping a social robot\nthat can be deployed in a high school setting. Th
 is robot\, called EMAR\, (Ecological Momentary Assessment Robot)\,\nis bei
 ng developed using participatory and human-centered approaches that engage
  high school students.\nOur hope is that by capturing the experiences of s
 tress in real-time\, an engaging social robot will gather much\nneeded\, a
 ccurate data to help researchers to better understand teen stress. In this
  talk\, we share two prototypes\nof the robot and how the teen design grou

DESCRIPTION:As streams of trace data about information work have prolifera

 easingly complex and difficult — with personal information streams fragm
 ented across devices and \nremoved from the site of work\, for example\, o
 ne’s ability to make sense of this trace data and use it productively to
  \nimprove knowledge work has become work in its own right. In this talk\,
  I present research that begins to explore two \nrelated challenges: (1) u
 nderstanding the ways in which knowledge workers are — and are not — m
 otivated to interact \nwith various representations of their trace data\, 
 and (2) understanding how to manifest trace data in the work \nenvironment
  in ways that make it present/visible in the right time and the right plac
 e as well as being appropriable \nfor helping individuals (and groups) imp
 rove their knowledge work practices. I conclude by reflecting on steps \nf
 orward at the intersection of these two challenges.\n\nStephen Voida is an
  Assistant Professor and founding faculty member in the Department of Info

DESCRIPTION:The applications we create are framed by the tools we use to c
 reate them. On one hand\, tools codify effective \npractice and empower de
 sign. On the other\, that same codification eventually constrains design. 
 My research examines \nnew approaches to interactive systems in light of t
 his tradeoff\, often with an emphasis on unlocking existing \ncodification
 s to enable new designs. This talk will focus on three examples:\n\n- I wi
 ll first present our work on unlocking data with interactive machine learn
 ing. Dominant models of interaction \n  fail to support expressiveness and
  control in many emerging forms of everyday data. Exploring such domains a
 s \n  web image search and gesture recognition\, our work shows how intera
 ctive machine learning can support people \n  in extending the underlying 
 language of an interaction.\n- I will then present our work on using pixel
 -based reverse engineering to unlock existing graphical interfaces\, \n  a
 llowing runtime modification of those interfaces without their source. Pix
 el-based methods allow prototyping \n  new possibilities atop the existing
  ecosystem of applications and tools\, accelerating innovation and informi
 ng \n  the next-generation ecosystem.\n- Finally\, I will consider how the
 se challenges combine in the emergence of self-tracking and personal infor
 matics. \n  Data is no longer a distant concept\, but an everyday barrier 
 to interaction\, self-knowledge\, and personal empowerment. \n  The tools 
 we create to support these applications will define the future of everyday
  interaction with personal data.\n\nGiven these examples\, I argue researc
 h must consider not only specific applications\, but also the assumptions 
 \ncodified by underlying tools and how those tools frame our understanding
  of what application designs are even possible.\n\nJames Fogarty is an Ass
 ociate Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the \nUniversity of 
 Washington (<https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty>). His broad resear
 ch interests are in \nengineering interactive systems\, often with a focus

DESCRIPTION:Mobility\, in some form or another\, drives our exploration of
 \, and participation in\, the world around us.\nIncreasingly\, scholars an
 d rehabilitation professionals are recognizing mobility as a basic human r
 ight\,\nand endorsing the efficacy of early powered mobility experiences f
 or children with mobility impairments\nin order to foster independence\, p
 romote socialization with peers\, and facilitate participation in family\n
 and community life. However\, the relationship between technology provisio
 n\, the mobility industry\, and\nuser-centered design\, when considered in
  the context of lived experiences of children with mobility\nimpairments a
 nd their families\, is complex and understudied. Perceptions of these expe
 riences from\nchildren’s own points of view are especially limited. This
  presentation will describe a unique technology\nhacking initiative develo
 ped at the University of Delaware called Go Baby Go and introduce research
  that\nhas emerged from the Go Baby Go program\, including work that explo
 res child and family experiences with\ntechnology design and the provision
  of mobility devices.\n\nThis data offers perspectives that may inform sta
 keholders who are seeking or developing technology\nsolutions for people w
 ith disabilities. Incorporating these perspectives is critical in advancin
 g\nthe features of mobility devices and provision practices\, and is essen
 tial in promoting further commitment\nto mobility advocacy\, environmental
  and attitudinal accessibility\, and more explicit child/family\ninvolveme
 nt in all phases of user-centered design.\n\nHeather earned her Bachelor o

DESCRIPTION:Research in HCI and computing education is continuously helpin
 g us better understand the barriers to learning and teaching\nprogramming.
  However\, many of the insights are based on the assumption that learners 
 will eventually write code (e.g.\, as a\nprofessional developer or a domai
 n-specific end-user programmer). But\, is this always the case?\n\nIn this
  talk\, I will be presenting our recent research which shows that some stu
 dents in fields such as management may not\naspire to write code as an end
 -user programmer or a professional programmer\, but are still strongly int
 erested in taking\nprogramming classes. We call these students   conversat
 ional programmers because they want to develop only conversational\nskills
  in programming literacy to be able to: 1) aid technical conversations wit
 h professional software developers in the\nfuture\; or 2) enhance their ma
 rketability in the software industry. I will also discuss results from our
  follow up study\nthat confirms the existence of such a population of conv
 ersational programmers in industry. Based on 3151 survey responses\nfrom n
 on-engineering professionals at a large technology company who never or ra
 rely wrote code on the job\, we found that\na significant number of them (
 42.6%) had invested in learning programming.  And\, their top motivations 
 to learn programming\nwere also to improve the efficacy of technical conve
 rsations and to acquire marketable skillsets. I will discuss some of\nthe 
 broader implications of these findings and new directions for future work 
 on conversational programmers.\n\nParmit Chilana is an Assistant Professor

DESCRIPTION:The convergence of social\, cloud and mobile computing has cre

 rsonal digital data at larger scales and faster rates than ever before. Fr
 om digital photo albums to online music streaming services\, these new tec

 ns that capture their life experiences. While these technological trends h
 ave created many opportunities\, they also raise complex questions for the
  HCI community as we critically look to the future and consider their long
 er-term implications. As archives continue to grow\, how will people live 
 with their virtual possessions in ways that support their evolving practic
 es\, values\, and understandings of self? How might people’s relations t
 o digital data and the technologies that manifest them change over time? W

  place for computational things in everyday life? In this talk I will draw
  on examples from my research to motivate these questions as a crucial res

DESCRIPTION:Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous but are not as y
 et all fully driverless. Autonomous technology is being introduced in phas
 es. This requires human drivers to continually adapt to their changing rol
 e inside the car. The human’s ability to decide when to take back contro
 l of the primary driving task is further complicated given system imperfec
 tions. As drivers adapt to increasing levels of automation\, they may chan
 ge their driving behaviour in ways that can compromise and even negate the
  intended system benefits. To design vehicles that account for limitations
  of both the human and the system\, it is essential to model such behaviou
 ral adaptation. This presentation will focus on the challenges and opportu
 nities in this modelling endeavour and their safety implications for all r
 oad users.\n\nLinda Ng Boyle is Professor and Chair of the Industrial & Sy

DESCRIPTION:This talk is based on the keynote presentation at the 18th Int
 ernational ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers\nand Accessibility (ASSET
 S 2016).   According to the Word Health Organization there are one billion
  people in the\nworld have a significant disability.  The view of disabili
 ty has changed over the past 100 years and continues to change.\nAccessibi
 lity has become a professional field both in research and practice.   Tech
 nology originally intended for people with\ndisabilities has become useful
  technologies for everyone.  More and more technology for people with disa
 bility\nare being built into mainstream products.  For example\, screen re
 aders are built into iOS and Android platforms.\nMainstream companies are 
 beginning to require knowledge of accessibility best practices in their jo
 b descriptions.\nMore and more accessibility research is appearing in main
 stream conferences.\nOverall\, accessibility is becoming mainstream in bot
 h research and practice.\n\nRichard Ladner is a professor in Computer Scie
 nce and Engineering at the University of Washington\,\nwhere he has been o
 n the faculty since 1971.  He received in B.S. degree in Mathematics at\nS
 t. Mary’s College of California in 1965 and his Ph.D. in Mathematics fro
 m the University of California\,\nBerkeley in 1971. After many years of do
 ing research in theoretical computer science\,\nhe turned his attention in
  2004 to accessibility research\, especially on technology for people\nwho
  are blind\, deaf\, and deaf-blind.  Some notable projects include the Tac
 tile Graphics Project\, MobileASL\,\nASL-STEM Forum\, and MobileAccessibil
 ity.  He wrote a short article for the SIGACCESS Newsletter about\nhis tra
 nsition from theoretical computer science research to accessibility resear

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Daniel McDuff (Microsoft Research) - "Emotion Measur
 ement in Natural Settings through Everyday Devices"

DESCRIPTION:Emotions play an important role in our everyday lives. They in
 fluence memory\, decision-making and well-being.  In order to advance the 
 fundamental understanding of human emotions\, build smarter affective tech
 nology\, and ultimately help people\, we need to perform research in-situ.
  It is now possible to quantify emotional responses on a large scale using
  webcams and wearable devices in everyday environments. I will present wor
 k on state-of-the-art automated facial expression recognition tools and in
 sights from analysis from the world’s largest dataset of naturalistic em
 otional responses (featuring examples from millions of individuals). I'll 
 show examples of how this data has allowed us to corroborate and extend th
 e understanding of nonverbal behavior\, including modeling gender and cult
 ural differences in expression (and what makes a viral video). I'll presen
 t methods for remotely measuring physiology using webcams that allow low-c
 ost and highly scalable measurement of cardio-pulmonary activity including
  heart rate variability allowing us to capture sympathetic nervous system 
 activity in addition to expressions. Finally\, I will discuss how this wor
 k will help us bring emotional intelligence to everyday digital devices an
 d potentially track important health conditions. \n\n[Daniel McDuff](http:
 //alumni.media.mit.edu/~djmcduff/) is a Researcher at Microsoft and works 
 on scalable tools to enable the automated recognition and analysis of emot
 ions and physiology. He is also a visiting scientist at Brigham and Women
 ’s Hospital in Boston where he works on deploying these methods in prima
 ry care and surgical applications. Daniel completed his PhD in the Affecti
 ve Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab in 2014 and has a B.A. and Masters
  from Cambridge University. Previously\, Daniel was Director of Research a
 t Affectiva and a post-doctoral research affiliate at the MIT Media Lab.  
 During his Ph.D. and at Affectiva he built state-of-the-art facial express
 ion recognition software and lead analysis of the world's largest database
  of facial expression videos.\n\nHis work has received nominations and awa
 rds from [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2011-05/2011-
 invention-awards-picture-health) magazine as one of the top inventions in 
 2011\, [South-by-South-West Interactive (SXSWi)](http://www.robertrmorris.
 org/pavlovpoke)\, The Webby Awards\, ESOMAR and the Center for Integrated 
 Medicine and Innovative Technology (CIMIT). His projects have been reporte
 d in many publications including The Times\, the New York Times\, The Wall
  Street Journal\, BBC News\, New Scientist and Forbes magazine. Daniel was
  named a [2015 WIRED Innovation Fellow](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/dan
 iel-mcduff-on-emotive-computing) and has spoken at [TEDx Berlin](http://ww

SUMMARY:DUB Seminar - Meredith Ringel Morris (Microsoft Research) - "Enhan
 cing the Throughput and Expressivity of Augmentative and Alternative Commu

DESCRIPTION:ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a degenerative neuromus
 cular disease\; people with late-stage ALS typically retain cognitive func
 tion\, but lose the motor ability to speak\, relying on gaze-controlled AA
 C (augmentative and alternative communication) devices for interpersonal i
 nteractions. State-of-the-art AAC technologies used by people with ALS do 
 not facilitate natural communication\; gaze-based AAC communication is ext
 remely slow (typically below 20 wpm\, compared to 190 wpm for conversation
 al speech)\, and the resulting synthesized speech is flat and robotic. In 
 this talk\, I will present a series of novel technology prototypes from th
 e Microsoft Research Enable team that aim to address the challenges of imp
 roving the throughput and expressivity of AAC for people with ALS.  \n\nMe
 redith Ringel Morris is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research\, whe
 re she is affiliated with the Ability\, Enable\, and neXus research teams.
  She is also an affiliate faculty member at the University of Washington\,
  in both the department of Computer Science and Engineering and the School
  of Information. Dr. Morris earned a Ph.D. in computer science from Stanfo
 rd University in 2006\, and also did her undergraduate work in computer sc
 ience at Brown University. Her primary research area is human-computer int
 eraction\, specifically computer-supported cooperative work and social com
 puting. Her current research focuses on the intersection of CSCW and Acces
 sibility ("social accessibility")\, creating technologies that facilitate 
 people with disabilities in connecting with others in social and professio
 nal contexts. Past research contributions include foundational work in fac
 ilitating cooperative interactions in the domain of surface computing\, an
 d in supporting collaborative information retrieval via collaborative web 
 search and friendsourcing. More information about Merrie\, including her f
 ull list of publications\, can be found on her website\, <http://meredithr
