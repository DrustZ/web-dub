# DUB Website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uwdub/web-dub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uwdub/web-dub)

This is an in-progress rebuild of the DUB website:
- It will eventually be hosted at <http://dub.washington.edu/>. 
- It is currently hosted at <http://dubstaging.cs.washington.edu/>.

In the interest of launching, our initial site will be fairly minimal. It will consist of static content, people, and the seminar calendar. It will not include publications. After we launch, we will add additional functionality.

Working toward launch, we first need to get enough of a skeleton in place for others to know how to contribute. This means the dub-web team working to set up the site, then going public with the larger DUB community, and giving them a bit of time to add content before we launch. Because the existing website is so dated, we do not need to give too much time.

We will use issues to flag what needs done. Please pitch in. If you are unsure how to help, or unsure how to manage your contributions via GitHub, just ask. We're happy to provide some coaching toward contributions.
