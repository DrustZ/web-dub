# DUB Website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uwdub/web-dub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uwdub/web-dub)

This is the repository for the DUB website, as hosted at: 

<http://dub.washington.edu/> 

The prior site had become very dated.
In the interest of launching to replace that site, this initial site is fairly minimal. 
It consists of basic static content and the seminar calendar. 
It currently does not include people, publications, or projects. 

## Roadmap

Now that we have launched, our upcoming priorities are:

1. Integrating the website calendar with a calendar feed.
2. Adding people profiles.
3. Adding publications.

## Issues

Issues and suggestions are tracked here:
