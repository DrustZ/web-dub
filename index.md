            <h2>The 7th Annual DUB Retreat</h2>
            <p>The Taskar Center for Accessible Technology director Anat Caspi presented as the keynote speaker at the 7th Annual DUB Retreat, which was held at the Intellectual House on October 16th, 2015. Anat talked about her work with the Taskcar center, and their most recent work - The Universal Play Kiosk - a configurable space designed to facilitate equal participation of all - was on display recently at the Seattle Design Festival.</p>
            <p>The Kiosk creates an immersive, collaborative environment that truly integrates children and adults with special needs. The modular structure accommodates wheelchairs and other assistive devices, is adjustable on the fly to welcome individuals of varying abilities, and provides rich sensory stimulation through colors, shadows, textures and sounds.</p>
