# What is DUB?

The DUB group is a grassroots, opt in alliance of faculty, students, researchers, and
industry affiliates interested in human-computer interaction and design at the 
University of Washington. The acronym DUB stands for Design, Use, Build. The 
mission of DUB is to bring together an interdisciplinary set of people to discuss
issues, share ideas, collaborate on research projects, and discuss teaching concerns 
related to the interaction between people and computers and major socio-technical 
phenomena surrounding them.

The DUB group first began in 2003, when it was recognized that there was a strength 
of research in the area of human computer interaction and design across many units 
on campus, and thus the idea of an alliance to bring these faculty, students, 
researchers, and industry affiliates was born. 

Members of the DUB community come from many departments on campus, including 
Computer Science & Engineering, the Information School, Human Centered Design & 
Engineering, the Division of Design in the School of Art, Biomedical & Health 
Informatics, Electrical Engineering, Architecture, Communications, and Psychology. 
However, DUB welcomes anyone to participate regardless of their home department. 
DUB also has industry research affiliates from Microsoft, Intel, Google, Adobe, and 
others.

The cornerstone activities of the dub group consist of: 

- A weekly lunch seminar on Wednesdays from 12:00-1:30. Sign up for the [dub 
  mailing list](/mailinglists.html) for announcements of topics and location.
- An annual reception at the CHI conference, as well as occasional receptions at 
  smaller conferences such as CSCW, UIST, and ASSETS.
- A yearly 1-day retreat for faculty, research-active students, and industry 
  affiliates.
- In addition, the DUB group leadership also leads the [Master of Human-Computer 
Interaction & Design](http://mhcid.washington.edu) (MHCI+D) degree, which is sometimes 
referred to as the "DUB Master's degree." The degree is officially co-owned by 
Computer Science & Engineering, the Information School, Human Centered 
Design & Engineering, and the Division of Design in the School of Art.
Although only the MHCI+D degree is overseen by the DUB group's leadership, other 
degree programs on campus are broadly related to human-computer interaction 
and design.

The following are departments that serve as DUB units:
