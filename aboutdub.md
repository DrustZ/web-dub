# What is DUB?

DUB is a grassroots alliance of faculty, students, researchers, and
industry partners interested in human computer interaction & design at the 
University of Washington. The DUB acronym stands for Design, Use, Build. 

The mission of DUB is to bring together an interdisciplinary set of people to share ideas, 
collaborate on research projects, and discuss teaching related to the interaction between design, people, and technology. 
DUB began when we recognized there is a strength of research in human computer interaction & design 
across many units at the University of Washington. For more than 10 years, DUB has helped bring these 
different people and perspectives together, promoting an interdisciplinary environment and 
one of the world's most vibrant communities for research and education in human computer interaction & design. 

Primary activities of the DUB group include: 

- A weekly lunch speaker seminar, on Wednesdays from 12:00-1:30. 
  Sign up for the [DUB mailing lists](/mailinglists.html),
  and see the [DUB calendar](/calendar.html) for announcements of seminar speakers, topics, and locations.
- An annual retreat for faculty, research-active students, and industry partners.
- An annual reception at the CHI conference, promoting broader visibility of the DUB community.
- Leadership of the [Master of Human-Computer Interaction & Design (MHCI+D)](http://mhcid.washington.edu) program,
  bringing together DUB's cross-campus perspectives in human computer interaction & design education.

Members of the DUB community come from many University of Washington departments.
