abstract: >
  The imperative to inspire young students, especially under-represented minorities and women, to pursue education and 
  careers in STE(A)M (Science, Technology, Engineering, (Art), and Math) fields is well known. The burning question is 
  how to do it effectively.
  
  For the past few years, we have been using a design activity known as a charrette as a way to introduce students to 
  the user-centered design (UCD) process. In our "UCD Charrette," students are given a particular design space to 
  explore (such as user interfaces for a web site, mobile app, or a physical device). In a very short period of time 
  (two hours or less), working in small groups, they brainstorm user needs, develop use-case scenarios, and create and 
  present interaction designs for an application. We have run these participatory workshops with students at various 
  levels, from middle school to graduate programs.
  
  In this talk, we will report on our recent experiences using our UCD Charrette in a variety of outreach efforts, most 
  especially a number of Puget Sound high schools.
