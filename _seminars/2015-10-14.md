abstract: >
  Search engines and web-based resources have become ubiquitous and essential tools for supporting the use of 
  interactive systems. (e.g, Microsoft PowerPoint, Adobe Photoshop, etc.) For example, people rely on web resources to 
  learn new tasks, troubleshoot problems, or remind themselves of key task details. This reliance on search engines and 
  web-based resources generates a rich set of signals that characterizes how the population thinks about and uses 
  software systems "in the wild," on a day-to-day basis. 
  
  In this talk, I demonstrate how these signals can be extracted and leveraged. Specifically, I show how logs of online 
  interactions can be used to identify potential usability problems in any publicly available interactive system. I 
  show how web tutorials can be used to map a broad user vocabulary to the narrow vocabulary expressed in a user 
  interface. Finally, I demonstrate how web resources and software applications can mutually enhance each other by 
  means of a shared interaction history. I conclude with an outline of my long-term research vision, which casts 
  software applications, web search, and online support materials as interoperating components of a larger holistic 
  system to be studied, designed, and evaluated in concert.

  Adam Fourney joined the MSR Context, Learning, and User Experience for Search (CLUES) research group in September of 
  this year, having recently earned his doctoral degree from the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University 
  of Waterloo, working under the supervision of Dr. Michael Terry. Adam also holds a master's degree from the 
  University of Waterloo, a bachelor's degree from the University of Ottawa, and has interned on two occasions at 
  Microsoft Research Redmond. Outside of his primary research interests, Adam is an active developer in the Pebble 
  smartwatch community.
