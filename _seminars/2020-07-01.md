    title: "Explain like I am a Scientist: The Linguistic Barriers of Entry to r/science"
    publication: "CHI 2020"
    video: 436532841
    abstract: |
      As an online community for discussing research findings, r/science has the potential to contribute to science outreach and communication with a broad audience. Yet previous work suggests that most of the active contributors on r/science are science-educated people rather than a lay general public. One potential reason is that r/science contributors might use a different, more specialized language than used in other subreddits. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the language used in more than 68 million posts and comments from 12 subreddits from 2018. We show that r/science uses a specialized language that is distinct from other subreddits. Transient (newer) authors of posts and comments on r/science use less specialized language than more frequent authors, and those that leave the community use less specialized language than those that stay, even when comparing their first comments. These findings suggest that the specialized language used in r/science has a gatekeeping effect, preventing participation by people whose language does not align with that used in r/science. By characterizing r/scienceâ€™s specialized language, we contribute guidelines and tools for increasing the number of contributors in r/science.

    title: "Who Are You Asking?: Qualitative Methods for Involving AAC Users as Primary Research Participants"
    publication: "CHI 2020"
    video: 436546300
    abstract: |
      When trying to understand people's perspectives, qualitative researchers in HCI often use methods which assume participants can easily communicate verbally. There are few dedicated resources in HCI which provide an overview of qualitative methods to effectively gather the perspectives of people who cannot easily communicate verbally; specifically, people who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). As a result, AAC users might be excluded from studies using methods such as interviews or focus groups, even if they fit the researcher's target population. To address this problem, I review literature from both HCI and therapeutic AAC research fields to discuss methods used with AAC users. In addition, I present relevant case examples from my own qualitative research and propose a framework to guide HCI researchers on choosing appropriate methods when involving AAC users as central research participants. I also identify design opportunities for HCI researchers to innovate on the tools and methods used for qualitative research with AAC users. This paper provides an easily accessible overview of qualitative methods HCI researchers can use with AAC users as participants.

  The DUB Shorts format focuses on sharing a research paper in a 15 to 20-minute talk,
  similar to traditional conference presentations of a paper.
  Speakers will first present the paper, then participate in Q&A.

  DUB shorts will be conducted using Zoom, via an invitation distributed to the DUB mailing list.
  Participants who are logged into Zoom using a UW account will be directly admitted,
  and participants who are not logged in to a UW account will be admitted using a Zoom waiting room.

  Speakers interested in presenting a DUB Short should submit our form:
