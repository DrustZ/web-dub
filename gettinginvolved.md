# DUB Seminars

The weekly DUB seminar features talks from visiting researchers, industries, and our own DUB researchers.
Members of DUB are all welcome and encouraged to attend the weekly DUB seminar. In addition, the seminar can be 
taken for credit as CSE 590J or HCDE 523.

Take a look at the <a href="/calendar.html#tab_upcoming_seminars">DUB Calendar</a> to see which upcoming seminars have been scheduled. 
You can also peruse the <a href="/calendar.html#tab_previous_seminars">archive</a> of previous seminars.

Video recordings of the DUB seminars are regularly uploaded onto the 
[DesignUseBuild Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/designusebuild). 
If you can't make it to the seminar, be sure to check out and subscribe to the channel to keep up with the latest 
research in human-computer interaction and design.

# Prospective Students

DUB is not an academic department, but we do have our own degree program (MHCI+D) that is jointly offered by the 
four primary DUB departments (CSE, Design, HCDE, and the iSchool).

In addition, students can participate in DUB from any department at the University of Washington, after they 
have been accepted into one of the participating graduate degree programs.

#### Ph.D. Programs

Ph.D. students involved in DUB come from a variety of degree programs across the University of Washington campus.
Students must apply and be accepted to one of the individual DUB departments. Students do, however, work 
with faculty from across the many units involved in DUB; it is common to see joint advising by faculty 
members in more than one department, and thesis committees often comprise members from multiple units. 
We also see many collaborative student research projects across units and jointly co-authored papers.

Please see the individual pages for each of the associated Ph.D. programs:

- [Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.washington.edu/prospective_students/grad)
- [Human Centered Design & Engineering](http://www.hcde.washington.edu/phd)
- [The Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/future/phd)
- [Biomedical & Health Informatics](http://www.bhi.washington.edu/welcomestudents)
- [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.washington.edu/academics/graduate/index.html)
- [DXARTS Digital Arts](http://dxarts.washington.edu/dxarts-phd)

#### Master's Programs

Four of the core departments involved in the DUB group (CSE, Design, HCDE, and the iSchool) identified a 
need for a degree program that combined the diverse expertise of each of the core departments into a single 
degree. The four departments came together and jointly designed, created, and sponsored a professional Master's 
degree that focuses specifically on human-computer interaction and design. The result was the MHCI+D degree 
mentioned above. The single year, full time, intensive degree program was launched in 2013 and is officially 
hosted in the Graduate School. Faculty from the four core units teach in the program, and students take 
electives directly from the four departments. The four departments also continue to offer their high quality, 
individual graduate programs that go more in-depth in the specific fields. The demand is high for all of these 
competitive, world-class programs.

Below is information on the joint MHCI+D program and the individual degrees offered by the four core DUB units, 
as well as related programs in other DUB units:
