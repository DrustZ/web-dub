# Mailing Lists

The DUB mailing lists are the primary channel for DUB announcements.
They are for faculty, students, researchers, and industry partners with an interest in
Human Computer Interaction & Design at the University of Washington.

We prefer you subscribe using your official email address (i.e., not a personal email).
University of Washington addresses are approved most quickly,
and posting is similarly restricted.

# DUB Seminars

The weekly DUB seminar is the primary gathering point for the DUB community.
The seminar features talks from researchers, practitioners, and our own DUB community.
All members of the DUB community are welcome and encouraged to attend the weekly DUB seminar.
Seminars during the academic year often attract 80 to 100 people, beginning with socializing and then the talk.

[The DUB mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/gettinginvolved.html#tab_mailing_lists) are used for seminar announcements.

[The DUB calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar.html) presents upcoming speakers, topics, and locations.

Videos of DUB seminar talks are posted to [the DUB calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar.html)
and [the DUB Vimeo channel](http://vimeo.com/designusebuild), with speaker permission.

The seminar can also be taken for credit.

# Prospective Students

DUB is not an academic department, so prospective students join DUB by joining a department or program that
participates in the University of Washington's Human Computer Interaction & Design community.

## Doctoral Programs

Doctoral students involved in DUB come from a variety of programs across the University of Washington.
Students must apply and be accepted to one of the individual DUB departments.
However, it is common to see students working with faculty from across the units involved in DUB,
common to see joint advising by faculty in multiple departments,
and common to see thesis committees comprising faculty from multiple departments.
There are also many collaborative student research projects across departments.

Please see the individual pages for each of the associated Ph.D. programs:

- [Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.washington.edu/prospective_students/grad)
- [Human Centered Design & Engineering](http://www.hcde.washington.edu/phd)
- [The Information School](http://ischool.uw.edu/future/phd)

- [Biomedical & Health Informatics](http://www.bhi.washington.edu/welcomestudents)
- [Communications](http://www.com.washington.edu/student-admissions/graduate-admissions-maphd)
- [DXARTS Digital Arts](http://dxarts.washington.edu/dxarts-phd)
- [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.washington.edu/academics/graduate)
- [Industrial & Systems Engineering](http://depts.washington.edu/ie/prospective/phd)
- [Mechanical Engineering](http://www.me.washington.edu/prospective/grad/admissions.html)
- [Psychology](http://www.psych.uw.edu/psych.php?p=137)

If you are unsure which program is the right fit for you, please talk directly with the departments.

You can also apply to multiple programs. The important thing is to come join us!

## Master's Programs

DUB faculty collaborate in leadership of the
[Master of Human-Computer Interaction + Design (MHCI+D)](http://mhcid.washington.edu) program.
This brings together together DUB's cross-campus perspectives in Human Computer Interaction & Design education.

Departments in the DUB community also continue to offer
their high-quality graduate programs that go more in-depth in the specific fields.
The demand is high for all of these competitive, world-class programs.
