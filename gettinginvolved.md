`do we want undergrads to get involved?`

# Graduate Admissions
Dub is not an academic department, but we do have our own degree program (MHCI+D) that is jointly offered by the four primary dub departments.
In addition, students can participate in dub from any department at the University of Washington, and can apply to degree programs that are offered by these departments.
